I just did my &quot;SFX.bnk&quot; following the tutorial and everything converted instantly. Did you forget to put your .bnk file in &quot;1- Extract SFX.bat&quot; or your antivirus blocked/deleted something? Are you on windows 10 ?

Don&#039;t forget that you *.ogg files can&#039;t be played by regular video/audio players. Audacity is a light program and does that for you.]]></description>
