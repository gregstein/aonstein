Thank you for taking you for taking your time to write this! I&#039;ve been trying to find answers on youtube without luck, but now you answered all my questions. Also, I now realise it&#039;s spelled &quot;deer&quot; and not &quot;dear&quot; lol]]></description>

Great question! 

When dears are close to your tc or maximum average of 15 tiles away, you have no excuse not to lure them. I would recommend to do.


When your civilization is a cavalry one and predicted to do scouts such as Franks, Indians, Slavs =&gt; Just lure those deers at least 1 or two even if they are far.


Why do we lure deers earlier? To skip building 1 or 2 farms at dark age and build a second lumbercamp faster that&#039;s the other key secret.


When you lure deers you&#039;d rather go up 20 or 21 pop up if you can.


&lt;strong&gt;I would not recommend luring deers in two situation:&lt;/strong&gt;


- Your game resolution is below or lower than 1920x1080 or 1680x1080. This advice is for beginners or slightly decent players.

- Beginner players are not advised yet to lure deers because they need to grasp and focus on the rest of the aspects of the game rather than luring deers or stealing boars.


&lt;strong&gt;How many dears is neccessary to lure and at which time stamp should you at latest go to scout your enemy?&lt;/strong&gt;


Even 1 deer is good, 2 deers are great, 3 deer is fantastic. As Mongols, Aztecs, Incas, or Mayans the timestamp to go scout your enemy is 5 or 6 mins due to their bonus LOS so you can basically lure deer the moment your scout meets the deers. I would almost always lure deers with these civs when possible. 


The rest of the civilizations 2 or 4 mins are perfect timestamps to start looking for the enemy so essentially you should stop luring at 4 or 5 mins max to go find what your enemy is doing.


&lt;strong&gt;do you think it is crucial to lure your dears?&lt;/strong&gt;


If available and possible to lure =&gt; Yes they are crucial then. Do not attempt to lure deers that are further away or bugged deers that spawn near gold patch + trees or other resource because they will keep going back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Greg, thank you for doing these guides, it really helps! I&#039;m wondering when should I go for luring scouts? Which scenario and which time? I was watching all games between TheViper and TheMax in the Hidden Cup 2 final and as far as I rememember both of them pretty much in all 7 games lured their dears. I&#039;m new to this game and have never payed attention to pros luring dears before but now I heard T90 talk about how crucial it was for your economy and that you should always do it unless you are doing something really agressive.
So back to my questions, do you think it is crucial to lure your dears? When should I do it? After doing on of your examples above such as the &quot;1/4 Circle-Scouting Style&quot;? How many dears is neccessary to lure and at which time stamp should you at latest go to scout your enemy? Thank you.]]></description>
