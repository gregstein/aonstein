Hello,

What makes this game ultra hard to learn is the economic part. To get better at this game you must practice the economic part piece by piece or chunk by chunk. For example: 
1- Practice all hotkeys first in scenario editor until you master them.
2- Practice scouting and finding 8 sheep, 2 boars before 6 mins (check my blog to see how to).
3- Practice the dark age eco until you click feudal age button which is 22 pop then repeat until you click around 8 mins.
4- Now practice to beat the hard ai and try to use all steps from above.

At this point you can read the rest of my blog posts and watch videos because you will understand everything so much easier.]]></description>
