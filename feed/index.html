At 31 pop you will have 5 idle shephards move them to chop a nearby tree then farm until 8 farms. 1 New and last villager goes to Gold Then Click Feudal Age at 32 pop.</div></div>
</p><h3>Economical Explained</h3><p>Playing economical is a semi-defensive play-style. You focus on your economy and economy upgrades than on spamming army or blacksmith upgrades.</p><p>A few important basics to perfect an economical style:</p><ul>
<li>Build 2 additional Town Centers</li>
<li>Do not rush blacksmith upgrades yet</li>
<li>Spend most of your wood on farms</li>
<li>Reach at least 28 or 30 farms at 30 mins</li>
</ul><h3>All-in Explained</h3><p>Playing an All-in usually means a mini-boom into a nonstop Castle age army production.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Q:</span> <strong>What&rsquo;s a mini-boom?</strong></p><p><span style="color: #008000;">A:</span> It is a One TC boom consisting of 24 Farmers and more and 12 gold miners and more. When I say &ldquo;and more&rdquo; meaning you need to balance your economy to have consistent food and gold income.</p><p>A few important basics to perfect an All-in:</p><ul>
<li>Do not build extra Town Centers yet</li>
<li>Spend wood on farms and military buildings</li>
<li>Have at least 24 farmers before 19 mins and rally new villagers to gold or wood depending on your needs.</li>
<li>Fully upgrade your army and force engagements or trades.</li>
</ul><h3>Analysis</h3><p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><img src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/techtree_feudal-age-e1588064453536.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Feudal Age goals" style="width:32px;height:32px" /> Feudal Age goals</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:46px"></div></div>
</p><p>Queue 3 villagers, build a stable and Blacksmith. Soon your forage bushes will deplete then send those foragers to build a new lumbercamp and chop trees. Once Clicking up to Castle Age, Upgrade:</p><ul>
<li><div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:38px;min-height:24px;line-height:24px"><img src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/doublebit-axe.jpg" width="24" height="24" alt="Double-Bit Axe" style="width:24px;height:24px" /> Double-Bit Axe</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:38px"></div></div></li>
<li><div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:38px;min-height:24px;line-height:24px"><img src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/horse-collar.jpg" width="24" height="24" alt="Horse Collar" style="width:24px;height:24px" /> Horse Collar</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:38px"></div></div></li>
</ul><p>Then build a second stable as soon as 175 wood is available.</p><p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><img src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/techtree_castle-age-e1588064509245.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Castle Age goals" style="width:32px;height:32px" /> Castle Age goals</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:46px"></div></div>
</p><p>Watching the build order you have noticed how I only upgraded bloodlines for knights. I did not bother to research anything at the blacksmith. Because playing economical you better make army instead of investing on upgrades. Besides you need food to have consistent villager production at your 3 town centers. Later on it is only easier to research any upgrade if you have a decent economy.</p><p>Notice how I did not over build military structures instead I focused on the <strong>build order objective</strong> which is reaching 30 farmers at 30 mins. And around 28 &ndash; 30 mins do not forget to research Handcart because of this latter your imperial age timing would be way faster and your economy gets a significant boost.</p><p>Before reaching Imperial age make sure to continue queuing villagers and fully upgrade your army and add extra military buildings because this is where the economical style shines. You will have all the resources to out-spam your opponent.</p><p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:46px;min-height:32px;line-height:32px"><img src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/techtree_imperial-age.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Imperial Age Goals" style="width:32px;height:32px" /> Imperial Age Goals</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:46px"></div></div>
</p><p>At Imperial your life becomes much easier as you reserve the freedom to do whatever army you wish. However I recommend you to build a few siege workshops then make those capped rams to help you destroy your opponent Castles and whatever structures in the way.</p></p>

</p><h2>Step by Step Instructions To 23 Pop Archer BO</h2><h3>Which Upgrades to Get On Archers First?</h3><p>
[wp_ad_camp_3]
</p><p>Before jumping into the build order I feel you must know which upgrades to prioritize over others.

[wp_ad_camp_4]
</p><p>Now you must be wondering.. What Should I do at Castle Age?</p><p>Upon reaching Castle Age, you must make the wisest decisions depending on what your opponent is doing. And the best way i see fit to help you is Q&amp;A approach.</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: My enemy is going for a Scout Rush, what to do ?</span></p><p>
<div id="attachment_1060" style="width: 428px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1060" class=" wp-image-1060" src="" alt="Good usage of spearman to protect against Scouts" width="418" height="277" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Spearmen-guarding-gold-forage-bushes.jpg 777w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Spearmen-guarding-gold-forage-bushes-483x320.jpg 483w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Spearmen-guarding-gold-forage-bushes-768x509.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Spearmen-guarding-gold-forage-bushes.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-1060" class="wp-caption-text">Good usage of spear-men to protect against Scouts</p></div>
</p><p><span style="color: #008000;">A:</span> Scout rush usually hits your base at 12:30 or 13 mins with 3 &ndash; 4 scouts. You will need 1 or 2 spears at all vulnerable spots. For example I like to have:</p><ul>
<li>Gold Miners guarded by: <strong>2 Spears</strong></li>
<li>Lumberjacks guarded by: <strong>1 Spear</strong> at 12 mins then <strong>2 Spears</strong> at 13&rsquo;ish mins ( Use your villagers to attack enemy scouts along with your spears)</li>
<li>Foragers can be easily sent back to Town Center or use the <strong>same spears</strong> from your wood line.</li>
</ul><h4>Two Rules to follow in order to take less damage possible from scout rush</h4><ol>
<li>Never chase 3 or 4 scouts with 1 Spear (Unless most of them are low hp)</li>
<li>Always send at least 2 spear-men with your archers to attack the enemy before castle age.</li>
</ol><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: Should I engage skirmishers?</span></p><p>
<div id="attachment_1061" style="width: 304px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1061" class="size-full wp-image-1061" src="" alt="Skirmisher with fletching upgrade" width="294" height="143" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Skirmisher-with-fletching.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-1061" class="wp-caption-text">Skirmisher with Fletching upgrade</p></div>
</p><p><span style="color: #339966;">A:</span> You can engage only if they don&rsquo;t have +1 Attack (Fletching) while you have it. To find out, click an enemy Skirmisher and check if his attack is only 2 (not 2 + 1) because 2 + 1 means he has fletching . See image below (You can use high ground and hills to gain an extra +1 attack when fighting enemy army)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: What If my opponent has many skirmishers while I&rsquo;m going up to Castle Age?</span></p><p><img class=" wp-image-1062 alignnone" src="" alt="Counter Skirmishers with Knights or Mangonels" width="428" height="182" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/countering-skirms.jpg"></p><p><span style="color: #339966;">A:</span> At 50% Before hitting Castle Age, sneak in 2 villagers to build a siege workshop near your enemy base. Use Mangonels to land some good shots or scare him away. Meantime your Crossbows are picking off villagers. Or instead of building a siege workshop you can build a stable and make 2 knights to clean all the skirmishers.</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: What if my opponent is fully walled since feudal age and has stables?</span></p><p><img class="wp-image-1063 alignnone" src="" alt="walled enemy" width="505" height="262" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy-617x320.jpg 617w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy-768x398.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy.jpg"></p><p><span style="color: #339966;">A:</span> Stables usually mean knights play. To counter that you must decide whether you go for an all-in or economic style. I will explain them both:</p><p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">All-in Style? </span>(No additional Town Centers but continue farming and building army and villagers non-stop</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p>Build a second barracks once you click up to Castle Age and queue both archers and spears. Research Plate armor for spears. Once you reach Castle Age, upgrade to Pikeman and Crossbows simultaneously.</p><p>Go forward with your army and 2 villagers then build a siege workshop near your enemy base and force fights and take down military buildings using rams or Mangonels. Preferably ram down Town centers if you can. <span style="color: #008000;">Most importantly never stop making army until you win or get significantly ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_5]
</p><p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Economic Style? </span>(Add 2 extra Town Centers and prioritize economic tasks and upgrades over military until you have enough villagers to support whatever plan you have in mind.)</strong></p><p>Once you reach Castle Age; upgrade to Crossbowmen; Build a monastery and 2 Town Centers. Use monks to convert his knights or scare him away. If the enemy builds a siege workshop you also build a defensive siege workshop. <span style="color: #008000;">Focus your energy on improving your economy and queuing more villagers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If he commits to knights you can either build an extra archery range and a university to research Ballistics then start sniping his knights one by one. Or Switch to Pikemen to defend your base and go up to imperial age first. At Imperial Age, if you civilization has access to Arbalests it&rsquo;ll be just easier to end up the game. Or Halberdiers Or Unique units or Paladins.. Whatever your civilization excels at use it.</p><p>

Wait for it&hellip; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><del><strong>Focusing on Villager kills</strong></del></span></p><p>While Killing a few villagers throughout the course of the game may set you ahead for several minutes&hellip; But honestly It&rsquo;s not enough against an opponent that focuses on the objectives of his build order.</p><p>A very common example which I have witnessed while spectating lower tier players: They had an army lead and a score lead since 12:00 mins to 20 mins. They even got 5 or 7 villager kills but still lost in Castle age.</p><p><strong>How? Why? <span style="color: #008000;">They have been behind economically by 7 &ndash; 8 farms at 16 mins or over mining gold.</span></strong></p><p>Without Further Redo let me unveil the secret goals of a 23 pop archers that no living pro has ever told you:</p><h4>1- Do not randomly attack any resource</h4><p><img class="wp-image-1051 alignnone" src="" alt="calculate your rushing abilities" width="487" height="209" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/calculate-every-move.jpg 700w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/calculate-every-move-622x267.jpg 622w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/calculate-every-move.jpg"></p><p>Your every moves must be calculated and based on the strategy that the enemy is going for and based on current time.. Only then You choose which resource to attack first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Against a Scout Rush</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1055 alignnone" src="" alt="Against Scouts build order" width="353" height="248" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scouts.jpg 530w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scouts-455x320.jpg 455w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scouts.jpg"></p><p><strong>@12:00 &ndash; 13:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Foragers and Farmers. If you can&rsquo;t only then attack the (2)lumberjacks</p><p><strong>@14:00 &ndash; 15:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners. If you can&rsquo;t only then attack (2)farmers. If you can&rsquo;t attack (3)lumberjacks</p><p><strong>@16:00 &ndash; 17:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners. If you can&rsquo;t only then attack (2)lumberjacks. If you can&rsquo;t attack (3)farmers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Against a Drush/Drush FC</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1056 alignnone" src="" alt="militias dark age rush (Drush)" width="352" height="247" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/militias-drush.jpg 530w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/militias-drush-455x320.jpg 455w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/militias-drush.jpg"></p><p><strong>@11:00 &ndash; 13:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners . If you can&rsquo;t only then attack the (2)Lumberjacks</p><p><strong>@14:00 &ndash; 16:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners. If you can&rsquo;t only then attack (2)Lumberjacks. (No value attacking farmers at this point)</p><p><strong>@16:00 &ndash; 19:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners. If you can&rsquo;t only then attack (2)Lumberjacks. If you can&rsquo;t attack (3)Farmers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Against Men At Arms</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1058 alignnone" src="" alt="men at arms play" width="355" height="250" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/men-at-arms.jpg 530w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/men-at-arms-455x320.jpg 455w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/men-at-arms.jpg"></p><p><strong>@11:00 &ndash; 13:00 mins:</strong> Attack Gold Miners or Lumberjacks first or (2) Stone miners if found.</p><p><strong>@14:00 &ndash; 19:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners. If you can&rsquo;t only then attack (2)Lumberjacks. If you can&rsquo;t only then Attack (3)Farmers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extended Tips:</p><ul>
<li>Idling enemy gold miners for a few seconds then running away with your army is better than getting 1 or 2 kills.</li>
<li>Killing 1 enemy gold miner is better than killing 1 lumberjack.</li>
</ul><h4>2- Force Enemy to Build defenses</h4><p><img class=" wp-image-1052 alignnone" src="" alt="force the enemy to build defences" width="417" height="250" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/force-enemy-build-defences.jpg 561w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/force-enemy-build-defences-534x320.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/force-enemy-build-defences.jpg"></p><p>Yet another trick to set your enemy behind is to force him to:</p><ul>
<li>Build a defensive Tower ( Later in castle age he can&rsquo;t build town centers which forces him to mine stone too and that is good for you)</li>
<li>Build Skirmishers &amp; Spears ( The more skirmishers/spears the enemy makes the more delayed to Castle age he will be. Simply go Castle age faster for the win)</li>
</ul><h4>3- Keep fights away from Your Town</h4><p><img class=" wp-image-1053 alignnone" src="" alt="Fighting near enemy base" width="473" height="283" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fighting-in-enemy-base.jpg 561w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fighting-in-enemy-base-534x320.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fighting-in-enemy-base.jpg"></p><p>I can not stress enough on the cruciality of initiating fights or engaging fights while at your opponent base or away from your own base. That way and first of all in case things go wrong enemy units can&rsquo;t rush into your base straight up in one glimpse of an eye. Then second You can split your army to cause chaos.</p><h5>A little distraction</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1054 alignnone" src="" alt="2 Archers behind a wood line" width="477" height="249" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/archers-behind-wood-line.jpg 750w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/archers-behind-wood-line-614x320.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/archers-behind-wood-line.jpg"></p><p>Put <span style="color: #339966;">1 or 2 archers behind his wood line</span> somewhere it takes him time to reach while you attack gold miners or farmers. If he chases your army and ignores that 1 or 2 archers; at that point your 1 or 2 archers have overdone their work.</p><p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> In case you have a bigger army, You rather split it to attack different resources than to attack one single resource.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
</p><h3>Greedy &amp; Cheesy Versions of 23 Pop Archers</h3><h4>18, 19 or 20 Pop Archers</h4><p><img class="size-full wp-image-1068 alignnone" src="" alt="18 19 or 20 pop feudal age" width="162" height="165" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18-19-20pop.jpg"></p><p>Some Civilizations get to Feudal age faster than the rest. For example:</p><ul>
<li><strong> Mongols:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18, 19 or 20 pop. Food is gathered 40% faster from Boars/Deers or any hunted animals .</li>
<li><strong>Britons:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18 or 19 pop. Sheep and goats food is gathered 25% faster <del>not turkeys or Cows</del>.</li>
<li><strong>Khmer:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 19 or 20 pop then skip building Barracks to build double archery ranges instead.</li>
<li><strong>Lithuanians:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18 or 19 pop due to +150 Dark Age food bonus.</li>
<li><strong>Huns:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 19 pop and since they do not need houses you will save up enough wood for Archery Ranges.</li>
<li><strong>Malay:</strong> Can click Feudal Age as late as 22 pop yet They reach Feudal age 66% faster. And that counts as 20 pop.</li>
<li><strong>Indians:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18 or 19 pop as villagers are cheaper to create.</li>
<li><strong>Italian: </strong>Can click Feudal Age with only 435 Food around 19 pop</li>
</ul><h4>Sneaky Archery Ranges</h4><p><img class=" wp-image-1064 alignnone" src="" alt="sneaky archery ranges" width="469" height="313" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-479x320.jpg 479w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-768x513.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers.jpg 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-1024x684.jpg"></p><p>The idea is as simple as it sounds. Send two villagers forward to build double archery ranges behind, right or left hand side your opponent. Be as stealthy as you can in order to catch your enemy off guard with an early 6 archers with Fletching.</p><p>If you are caught in the process of building the archery ranges well that could be pickle to deal with. Often the enemy will pull villagers to wall in your archery ranges or tower them. Or they can respond with an early Archery range and counter you with 6 to 11 skirmishers then go up to castle age faster than you.</p><p>In this situation, you are looking at one option:&nbsp; Full Feudal Age war. Send 3 villagers to stone and build a stable then mix in both archers and skirmishers + scouts and build towers as soon as you bank 125 stone. To succeed with your Full Feudal war you must over farm and focus on Food and Wood resources primarily. Meaning..</p><ul>
<li>Do not exceed 4 Stone miners</li>
<li>Do not exceed 4 to 6 Gold Miners</li>
</ul><h4>Benchmarks For Raiding Your Opponent</h4><h5>Tiny Attack (2 Archers + 2 Spears)</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1065 alignnone" src="" alt="2 archers and 2 spears tiny rush" width="346" height="172" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-archers-2-spears.jpg"></p><p>At 12:00 &ndash; 12:30 mins, This tiny attack is meant to stop an opponent from walling or idle his economy a little too early. It is most effective against a Scout rush build. Most importantly, DO NOT lose this tiny army trying to get 1 kill. We have discussed previously that idling enemy villagers is more worthy than killing 1 or 2 villagers.</p><p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Forget about Kills! Focus on Idling Economy.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
</p><h5>Small Attack (6 &ndash; 8 Archers)</h5><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1066 " src="" alt="6 archers + fletching being researched" width="328" height="215" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-archers.jpg"></p><p>Around 14:30 mins, you should move out with 6 archers (+2 spears against Scouts play). You must focus this small attack on enemy gold miners but if you can not only then attack his lumberjacks or farmers. Do not over stay if the enemy has army of his own. Again it&rsquo;s not worth to lose your army for 2 kills; However forcing him to hide villagers for a few seconds then run away is&nbsp; mostly worth it.</p><p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Use Hit and Run tactics. Sneak your archers from different angles and corners. Get kills when you can. Try to keep your army as alive as you can.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
</p><h5>Main Attack ( 12 &ndash; 20)</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1067 alignnone" src="" alt="19 archers" width="482" height="385" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19-archers.jpg 666w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19-archers-401x320.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19-archers.jpg"></p><p>By <strong>17:00 mins</strong>, your army count should be over 12 archers and&hellip; Have you saved those <strong>6 &ndash; 8 Archers</strong> from the previous small attack? That would make your army even stronger and larger in number. If necessary you can go for the Padded Archer Armor upgrade to improve the resistance of your archers against enemy units such as Skirmishers and Scouts.</p><ul>
<li>Against a greedy and walled enemy you can split your army then attack from different angles as long as he does not have a scary army to cut you off with.</li>
<li>Against an enemy with a considerable army size or a combo of archers and scouts. You must be cautious not to walk into your death by shoving your army without scouting information about where enemy army is located. In fact I would recommend you to focus on idling your town center to save up enough food to go up to Castle Age. Once at Castle Age first; feel free to shove into your opponent base with crossbowmen and micro your way in.</li>
</ul><p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Losing your archers before Castle age is a suicide. Rather wait to upgrade to Crossbowmen to deal maximum damage.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Tips</h2><p>23 Pop Archers is certainly a viable build order in any tier or skill level. Just learn to do some efficient walling to be ready against the worst of it. Do not forget that the biggest point of weakness of this build is<strong> Gold Miners.&nbsp;</strong>Build your military structures in front of your gold mines and prioritize protection first and foremost to your gold miners. Then your Woodline.</p><p>One more tip, watch replays you lost and talk to yourself what you could have done better. Because next time you will react to those situation without second thoughts.</p></p>

</p><p>Two months ago, I was one of the last users to receive a beta key for AoE2 DE. But anyhow I installed the game and ran it &ndash; I was so excited to test it out.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1011 size-large" src="" alt="main menu of age of empires 2 definitive" width="620" height="349" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de.jpg 1918w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-1024x576.jpg"></a></p><p>I immediately jumped into the single player to test&hellip;and here we go.. freezing and crashing within 15 mins of the game. Besides I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing that my audio was a bit choppier from moment to another.</p><p>In a nutshell, These are the issues I came across repeatedly:</p><ul>
<li>Game crashed after 5 &ndash; 15 mins</li>
<li>Blackscreen then my audio is not working anymore (had to restart pc to fix)</li>
<li>Choppy sound at random moments and sometimes for the entire gameplay</li>
<li>Random frame drops and freezes</li>
<li>Game takes 2 &ndash; 3 minutes to run</li>

</p><h2>Game Crashing and Freezing</h2><p>I may have succeeded in bringing the game performance to a higher level BUT&hellip;. the crashes and freezes were often occurring in mysterious circumstances in which I had to investigate further.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_4]
</p><p>These are the remaining issues:</p><ul>
<li>After 30 &ndash; 40 mins: Blackscreen then my audio is not working anymore (had to restart pc to fix)</li>
<li>Choppy sound at random moments and sometimes for the entire gameplay</li>
<li>2 out 15 games I crashed</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Change Power Settings</h3><p>I quickly changed my power plan to High Performance by pressing <kbd>Windows Key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to bring up the &ldquo;RUN&rdquo; command then type in:</p><pre class="de1">powercfg.cpl</pre><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010" src="" alt="high performance power plan for aoe2 de" width="942" height="445" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance.jpg 942w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance-622x294.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance-768x363.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance.jpg"></p><p>Then Select<strong> &ldquo;High Performance Plan&rdquo;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Fix Crashes, Black-Screen &amp; Choppy Audio</h3><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>THIS IS THE BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT SECTION IN THIS GUIDE!</strong></span></p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s 95% likely that the crashes and freezes would be long gone after this section.</strong></p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-1006 aligncenter" src="" alt="Fix for Crashing, Freezing and Blackscreen/Audio issues" width="650" height="387" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-is-not-responding.jpeg 650w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-is-not-responding-537x320.jpeg 537w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-is-not-responding.jpeg"></p><p>It is funny how the crashing, blackscreen and audio were so related and linked with each other.

A few months ago I purchased an external wifi card and plugged directly into my computer without installing the drivers then I started getting random BSOD errors (Blue Screen) at random days until I checked my event viewer to find error logs related to my wifi card.</p><p>It instantly hit me that I did not install any drivers so I installed my drivers then afterwards downloaded <a title="Driver Booster" href="https://www.iobit.com/en/driver-booster.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Driver Booster</a> just to double check my drivers are up to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Indeed the switch to SSD was the biggest performance improvement however some of the issues remained until I started investigating and figured out that malwarebytes along with unnecessary components have been hindering windows from delivering the perfect performance.</p><p>My recommendation to you is to keep your drivers updated especially when introducing a new device into your system such as an external usb wifi. Avoid Avast and AVG as they do impact your system severely but you can use better antivirus such as Comodo Internet Security (Free) or Kaspersky Free these two are perfect for gaming.</p><p>I hope this guide was helpful to you and let me know in the comment section if you have any issues with any version of age of empires 2.</p></p>

</p><p>As you can see the mod is still not perfect because I mod it manually without any software (the colors for only idle villagers are somewhat darker). But nothing to worry about as soon as the necessary tools and software are released (which may takes a few months or weeks from now) I promise to update it instantly.</p><p>Just a side note this mod was originally coined by a good friend of mine <a title="Dedpool voobly" href="https://www.voobly.com/profile/view/124048115" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dedpool</a> and some credits goes Gallas for being the source of inspiration. I&rsquo;m entitled to some credits as well for porting this mod from scratch <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Advanced Idle Pointer &ndash; Offline Installer</h2><p>I understand some of you may prefer to just offline install AIP which is why i built this little cutie app that takes care of that in a matter of seconds.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985" src="" alt="advanced idle pointer offline installer program" width="582" height="384" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aip_offline_app.jpg 582w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aip_offline_app-485x320.jpg 485w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aip_offline_app.jpg"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DOWNLOAD APP:</strong> <a title="Advanced Idle Pointer Offline Installer" href="https://github.com/gregstein/AoE2Tools/blob/master/packages/AIP%20Offline%20Installer%20%5BGregStein%5D.zip?raw=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Advanced Idle Pointer Offline Installer</a></p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_4]
</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This application works for only AoE2 DE steam installations.</strong></span> Microsoft Store installations have restrictions on the game folders (secured access). I could have made it compatible but Microsoft Store may not operate as intended.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This guide will help you make the jump from Beginner and intermediate level into upper-intermediate and higher.<p>Rest assured! You will not waste your time here because most these tips are priceless and meant to particularly improve the mechanical aspect of your gameplay.&nbsp; These tricks may only apply to Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_1]
</p><h2>Mechanics &amp; Tricks</h2><p>The release of the definitive edition has been a blessing so far particularly in the amount of brand new mechanics that brings to the table.</p><p>In this section you will learn most of those fancy tricks that the pros employ everyday. The rest of them will be covered in the other sections of this guide.</p><p>Instead of writing down a how to use text section for every trick I feel it would be more interesting and easy to grasp if I render short clips for a tangible live-preview.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Re-assigning Units With a Simple Trick</h3><p>Why? It prevents you from idling villagers after they construct whatever you assigned to. Or re-assigning siege rams for instance to destroy buildings in a particular order.</p><p>Hotkey Combination: <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + Mouse (Right Click)</p><p style="text-align: center;"><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKegybKYNl4?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Hill Fights</h3><p>
<div id="attachment_967" style="width: 422px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-967" class="wp-image-967 " src="" alt="Always take uphill fights" width="412" height="232" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight-1024x576.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-967" class="wp-caption-text">Always take uphill fights</p></div>
</p><p>Why? Fighting uphills while Enemy down-hills inflects 25% <strong>BONUS</strong> damage to the enemy. Fighting down-hill reduces damage by 25%&nbsp;to units uphill.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaOu_wgDGog?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Boar Lure Like a Pro</h3><p>Why? Gain time &amp; efficiency.</p><p>Hotkey Combination (1): <kbd>H</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> +Mouse (Right Click)&nbsp; [Using Classic Hotkeys]
</p><p>OR My Personal Combination(2): <kbd>4</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> + Mouse (Right Click) [ Changed &lsquo;Set Gather Point&rsquo; hotkey to <kbd>F</kbd>]
</p><p style="text-align: center;"><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mePacWWfgAo?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Hotkeying Shepherds</h3><p>Why? For 3 reasons:</p><ol>
<li>Take Full Control of your Shepherds so they would not kill sheep you don&rsquo;t want them to.</li>
<li>Quickly drop food onto your town center.</li>
<li>Killing boars at ease.</li>
</ol><p>My Personal Hotkey Combination: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd></p><p style="text-align: center;"><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4NA-cz3OxG4?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Quick Walls</h3><p>Why? Prevent or render dark or feudal age militia/scout rushes useless. (Grid Mod is recommended as one square represents the foundation for the palisade.)</p><p>Hotkey Combination: <kbd>B</kbd> + Wheel Up (Mouse) [Changed &lsquo;Palisade wall&rsquo; hotkey to Wheel Up for a faster reaction)</p><p style="text-align: center;"><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-enjehv9A4?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Hotkeys For Technologies</h3><p>Why? Gain time and never switch the point of view in the middle of a fight.</p><p>Access the main menu or while in-game Press <kbd>F10</kbd> &gt; &nbsp;<strong>Options</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&gt;</span> <strong>Hotkeys</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&gt; </span><strong>Blacksmith; Archery Range; etc. &lt;= Set your own hotkeys for technologies.</strong></p><p>

</p><h2>Static Hotkeys</h2><p>Great news! AoE2 DE comes exclusively with lots of advanced hotkeys unlike the previous editions of the conquerors and 2013( a.k.a HD). So&hellip; Are you taking advantage of them yet?</p><p>Even if you have I am pretty sure you are missing out on setting static control groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Problem</span></strong></p><p>For example, I use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> on my Town Center(s) &amp; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> on all my buildings. In the early game it&rsquo;s a breeze to bind my barracks, stables and archery ranges all together using <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd>. The reasoning behind that is to set the rally point for all my military building into a desired location (extremely helpful to assist aggression and not idling army).</p><p>However.. In Imperial Age or Post-Castle-Age I have many military buildings distributed across the map and at different locations..&nbsp; And that makes it hard to bind them all under <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd>.&nbsp; Though my APM is high, I lose 2 to 5 seconds looking for my buildings and rebinding them.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_2]
</p><p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Solution</strong></span></p><p>In Age of Empires 2, The Definitive Edition there is a hotkey item that selects all military buildings as well as select all town centers. Now we are going to change it to your desired number. In my case, Select All Military Buildings is set to <kbd>5</kbd>; Select All Town centers is set to <kbd>4</kbd></p><p>Where to find these hotkey items?</p><p>Go to: <strong>Options</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&gt;</span> <strong>Hotkeys</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Game Commands</strong></span></span></p><p>Scroll down a little bit until you find them. Screenshot..</p><p>
<div id="attachment_960" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-960" class="wp-image-960 size-large" src="" alt="select all hotkeys" width="620" height="202" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs-1024x333.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs-622x203.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs-768x250.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs.jpg 1293w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs-1024x333.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-960" class="wp-caption-text">I got an AZERTY keyboard layout that explains &ldquo;5&rdquo; appearing as open bracket and &ldquo;4&rdquo; appearing as single quote.</p></div>
</p><p>From now on.. 4, and 5 become static control hotkeys and you never have to press the combination key <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> to bind your military buildings, or <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> your Town Centers ever again.&nbsp; Besides an economic advantage is that you can multi-queue villagers from all Town Centers without switching view.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_3]
</p><p>For example, I can take a fight and at the same time click once on number <kbd>4</kbd> then <kbd>C</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. This way I&rsquo;m fighting and queuing villagers from 3 town centers without changing view to all of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Building Your Rhythm</h2><p>
<div id="attachment_965" style="width: 440px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-965" class="wp-image-965 size-full" src="" alt="Finding your game rhythm in age of empires 2" width="430" height="311" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-morten-harket-rhythm.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-965" class="wp-caption-text">Morten Harket/A-HA</p></div>
</p><p>Every living thing in this world has a rhythm or a music..&nbsp; So what&rsquo;s a rhythm? In a nutshell it is an unconscious habit that puts order into our lives.</p><p>It could be a daily rhythm such as: <strong>(a)</strong>Take Breakfast&nbsp; <strong>(b)</strong>Go To School <strong>(c)</strong>Take Lunch <strong>(d)</strong> Go To school <strong>(e)</strong>Play video-games<strong> (f)</strong>Watch TV <strong>(g)</strong>Go to Sleep&hellip; Repeat.</p><p>Or a rhythm constituting a task. A very good example of that are musicians and what makes a good rhythmical song is the chorus or refrain that remains unchanged and occurs repeatedly in a song.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_4]
</p><p>For instance if we analyse &ldquo;Take on me&rdquo; a song by A-HA (Morten Harket). The following lines occur after every section of the song:</p><blockquote>
<div class="secrsf">Take on me (take on me)<br>
Take me on (take on me)<br>
I&rsquo;ll be gone<br>
In a day or two</div>
</blockquote><p>Back To Age of Empires 2.. Where I will be showing you how to build up your rhythm to organize your game-play to the better&hellip;</p><p>First of all and through out the game we need to organize our multitasking and build up a repetitive sequence of tasks.</p><p>For example and speaking of myself as an experienced player in this game, I like to organize my tasks (rhythm) as follow:</p><p>
<div class="su-table su-table-alternate">
</p><table class="editorDemoTable">
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>My Rhythm Explained</strong></td>
<td><strong>Hotkeys Used</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Go to my Town Center(s) and do something with it.</td>
<td>Control group <kbd>4</kbd> or <kbd>H</kbd> key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Check my scout or army and do something with them</td>
<td>Control group <kbd>1</kbd> and advanced commands (attack, stance ground, etc.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Check the mini-map to spot enemies or resources, check time, my collected resources and population.</td>
<td>No hotkeys just eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Check my lumberjacks, foragers, shephards, hunters and miners</td>
<td>I use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> to switch view to lumberjacks. <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> to switch view to foragers/hunters, <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> to switch view to gold/stone miners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. Create army from my military buildings</td>
<td>I use <kbd>D</kbd> key to go to archery ranges, <kbd>R</kbd> to go to stables</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. Check for any idles</td>
<td>I use <kbd>SPACE</kbd> key to go to idle villagers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7. Do whatever extra things i can such as walling, reassigning villagers, etc.</td>
<td>I put control group numbers <kbd>3</kbd> or <kbd>7</kbd> on my builders or villagers out in the open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I REPEAT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7</td>
<td>I REPEAT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>
</div>
</p><p>The table above represents my rhythm and please feel free to use it or discover your own music. There is only one rule to make a successful rhythm and that rule is to always prioritize important tasks.&nbsp;Giving priority to the wrong tasks is going to change the outcome of the game.</p><p>Bear in mind this is a dual challenge you need to (1)<strong>use this rhythm or write yours</strong> + (2)<strong>repeat it as fast as you can and even under enemy pressure</strong>.</p><p>It should take time before singing your song and taking on every game. Just keep practicing the same rhythm over and over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use My AoC Practice Sheet</h2><p>

</p><p>Not a long ago and while I was practicing a lot of 1v1 games I came up with an idea to collect my gameplay issues in an organized table sheet.</p><p>It was mandatory to establish this sheet as I played around 10 games a day but more importantly I couldn&rsquo;t keep track of my common mistakes, errors and bad habits.</p><p>The idea behind this practice sheet is extracting all kind of gameplay issues we are facing then in the next game we concentrate mainly on avoiding those issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a my <a title="AoC Practice Sheet" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_21WgbQD36ejSrr19a1P0XJT7UdDzHeHr5YbWf3T6k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AoC Practice Sheet</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Problem</strong></span></p><p>For example, if you struggle finding your sheep or boars the next game you must give 90% of your energy to improve your scouting and finding your resources before 5 mins in-game time.</p><p>Another common issue that a beginner struggles with is NOT keeping the town center pumping villagers. The next game they must give priority to making villagers first and foremost (Town center always queuing villagers without any second of delay) then do the rest of the tasks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Solution</span></strong></p><p>I have published a few videos where I jumped into a random 1v1 game of low skilled players and collected their issues into the practice sheet professionally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/97C4H5BxMXE?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></div>

</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Visual Mods &amp; Game Settings</h2><p>The biggest part of being a good player is taking advantage of any mod you can get. I&rsquo;m not talking about &ldquo;No birds, No plants&rdquo; or terrain mods&hellip; Because all of the mods that beautify the view of the game are more or less optional.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_5]
</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about..</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Small Trees</h3><p>
<div id="attachment_972" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-972" class="size-large wp-image-972" src="" alt="small trees - Decreases the height of trees for better visibility" width="620" height="349" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020-1024x576.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-972" class="wp-caption-text">small trees &ndash; Decreases the height of trees for better visibility</p></div>
</p><p>This mod is a user experience improver and not a single experienced player can play competitively or hop into multiplayer without it.</p><p>If you take 2 experienced players of the same level. One player consuming small trees mod while the other player is not. The player without mods will sweat his ass off to reassign lumberjacks to nearby trees since the original big trees will deny you from clicking accurately on a desired tree especially if they take any forest in the back of their base.</p><p>Besides it&rsquo;s difficult to spot your own villagers behind forests&hellip;And it becomes even more challenging if you pick green color (p3).</p><p><strong>INSTALL LINK:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/790/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/790/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Light Grid Mod</h3><p>
<div id="attachment_971" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-971" class="size-large wp-image-971" src="" alt="Zetnus Improved Light Grid Mod" width="620" height="369" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/light-grid-mod-1024x609.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/light-grid-mod-538x320.jpg 538w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/light-grid-mod-768x457.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/light-grid-mod.jpg 1210w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/light-grid-mod-1024x609.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-971" class="wp-caption-text">Zetnus Improved Light Grid Mod</p></div>
</p><p>So many grid mods and terrain grids are out there for consumption but are you ready embrace them yet?</p><p>Today, I will convince you as to why they are a must&hellip;</p><p><strong>INSTALL LINK:</strong> <a title="https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/812/" href="https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/812/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/812/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Problem</strong></span></p><p>For example, I have loom-less foragers collecting berries then suddenly an enemy Drush ( militia dark age rush) is heading towards my foragers. The grid helps as to where to lay down quick palisade walls. One square represents a foundation for a palisade wall or stone wall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Solution</span></strong></p><p>Thanks to the grids I know exactly where to build palisades precisely&hellip; However the grids shines the most on maps with elevations where it&rsquo;s impossible to see a hidden square in your walls and that usually could cost you the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that some of you including myself may not enjoy little squares all over the place that is why there is a light grid mod version reducing the grid thickness to exquisite light barely noticeable squares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Huge Number</h3><p>
<div id="attachment_970" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-970" class="wp-image-970 size-large" src="" alt="Huge Number - Increase control group numbers up to 50% for an optimal visibility" width="620" height="388" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/huge-number-mod-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/huge-number-mod-511x320.jpg 511w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/huge-number-mod-768x481.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/huge-number-mod.jpg 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/huge-number-mod-1024x641.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-970" class="wp-caption-text">Huge Number &ndash; Increase control group numbers up to 50% for an optimal visibility</p></div>
</p><p>This mod increases the control group numbers font size to a reasonable one because the current size is insanely small especially on 1920&times;1080 or higher screens.</p><p>The solution comes very handy to all level players assisting everyone to see assigned hotkeys for units and buildings at the first glimpse rather than having to squinch their eyes.</p><p><strong>INSTALL LINK:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/1779/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/1779/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus</h2><p>Interested in consuming the same hotkeys profile employed in this tutorial? Here: <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AgeofNotes-Hotkeys.zip">Age Of Notes Hotkeys</a></p><p>How to install them?</p><h3>Method 1 (Manual):</h3><p><strong>1.

A lot of pictures and illustrations are enclosed to assist my short and concise explanations.<p>Feel free to expand the &ldquo;guide contents&rdquo; to hop into topics of your interest.</p><h2>Civilizations &amp; Campaigns</h2><p>
[wp_ad_camp_4]
</p><h3>Civilizations &ndash; What&rsquo;s New?</h3><p>4 new civilizations are introduced into AOE 2 Definitive:</p><ol>
<li>Bulgarians</li>
<li>Cumans</li>
<li>Lithuanians</li>
<li>Tartars</li>
</ol><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/civilizations-aoe2de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-947 size-full" src="" alt="4 New Civilizations" width="716" height="535" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/civilizations-aoe2de.jpg 716w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/civilizations-aoe2de-428x320.jpg 428w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/civilizations-aoe2de.jpg"></a></p><h3>Campaigns &ndash; What&rsquo;s New?</h3><p>
<div style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large" src="" alt="All 27 campaigns of age of empires 2 definitive" width="480" height="287" data-layzr="https://media.giphy.com/media/fwEH9iSvZey9giI99o/giphy.gif"><p class="wp-caption-text">All 27 Campaigns of Age of Empires 2 Definitive</p></div>
</p><p>The game comes with 27 campaigns (2 new campaigns) and each campaign has several chapters spanning over 200 hours of gameplays and 1000 years of human history. You won&rsquo;t need to take history classes anymore because of this..</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-946 size-large" src="" alt="history ingame learning" width="620" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-1024x529.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-620x320.jpg 620w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-768x397.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-622x320.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring.jpg 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-1024x529.jpg"></a></p><p>Or play the campaigns to learn the history course in an audio/visual approach. <strong>Well If I had a 13 years old son or daughter I would definitely get AoE2 Definitive for them.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Historical Battles</h3><p>There is no doubt that most of us have loved Age of Empires 2 due to quality campaigns game-plays we enjoyed in our childhood. Now and even if you have finished all the campaign missions you can still get a taste of historical battles which are 16 battles in total.</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-948 size-large" src="" alt="Historical battles" width="620" height="408" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles-486x320.jpg 486w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles-768x506.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles.jpg 1467w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles-1024x674.jpg"></a></p><p>I personally couldn&rsquo;t be more satisfied with all these campaigns and historical battles. I&rsquo;m definitely hoping into a few historical battles after writing this post.</p><h2>Single Player &ndash; What&rsquo;s New?</h2><p>
[wp_ad_camp_5]
</p><p>Major graphical changes have been made to Single Player supplemented with a few interesting additions. Let&rsquo;s have a look..</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-932 size-large" src="" alt="Single player for AoE2 DE 2019" width="620" height="411" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de-1024x679.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de-482x320.jpg 482w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de.jpg 1354w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de-1024x679.jpg"></a></p><p>At the first sight, we notice that the single player structure remained the same <strong>except for the number of players</strong> which has been moved under the player spots &ndash; It&rsquo;s so much better that way in a sense of visibility.</p><h3>New Presentation for Maps</h3><p>Locations or (Maps) have gotten better..</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-933 size-large" src="" alt="Locations and maps pool - AoE2 DE" width="620" height="396" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de-501x320.jpg 501w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de-768x491.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de.jpg 1406w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de-1024x654.jpg"></a></p><p>There are 9 Game Modes so far:</p><ol>

Health Bars are annoying in this current patch and unresponsive.

Port forwarding is not needed <strong>99,98%</strong> of the cases because a client server model relies mainly on TCP protocol to receive your commands and actions then the server returns a response to each player. By default TCP is always operational protocol even in Mobile broadband connections unlike UDP protocol.</p><p>The only case when you have to port forward is when your router is intentionally set to block any random TCP traffic through the firewall; or your Antivirus/firewall is blocking the server ip or traffic to that ip.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Can I play Age of Empires 2 DE with Mobile internet, would I lag?</h2><p><img class="size-medium wp-image-906 alignnone" src="" alt="Play AoE 2 DE with mobile broadband connection" width="461" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming-461x320.jpg 461w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming-461x320.jpg"></p><p>Yes! You can play using Mobile internet unless (your internet provider blocks gaming activities) but that&rsquo;s extremely rare. Lag is measured based on your internet speed and ping.</p><p>A minimum requirement is 2 MB download, 0.3 Upload and a low Ping which is also crucial to communicate with multiplayer servers.&nbsp; Because It determines how much delay you are getting in the course of the game-play. However the game is less likely to stuffer as in peer-to-peer.</p><h2>What if one or more than one player are lagging, would they affect the rest of the players?</h2><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-918 size-medium" src="" alt="multiplayer reasons to lose" width="368" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png 368w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png"></p><p>No! Whoever lags will lag himself not others. 3G internet speed of at least 2 MB download, 0.3 upload and a decent ping is the bare minimum for an average to good multiplayer experience.</p><h2>What if my internet drops for less than 60 seconds, would I get back to the game?</h2><p><img class="size-medium wp-image-908 alignnone" src="" alt="drops in aoe2 de are fixed" width="448" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop-448x320.jpg 448w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop-448x320.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes! One of the outstanding advantages of this brand-new multiplayer is the ability to get back into the game if you have dropped for less 60 seconds, therefore, other players won&rsquo;t have to save and exit then restore again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What if the servers are down, Can we play multiplayer?</h2><p><img class=" wp-image-909 alignnone" src="" alt="servers are down thus multiplayer" width="430" height="228" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg 603w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-768x407.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-300x160.jpg 300w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down.jpg 950w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg"></p><p>No! When the servers are down you have to wait until they are back on to play multiplayer, however you can still play single player or watch recorded games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>In a multiplayer game, My game crashed and shut down, Can I run it again and get back to game?</h2><p><img class=" wp-image-910 alignnone" src="" alt="game crashing unexpectedly" width="495" height="171" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png"></p><p>Yes! When your game shuts down while playing multiplayer, you should be able to get back to the game but you have to join in less than 60 seconds or whatever the timeout is set to. Also It depends if this feature is implemented or not however it is entirely possible to add.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Would players in a far region struggle with other regions?</h2><p><img class="wp-image-912 alignnone" src="" alt="regions and pings" width="452" height="532" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/regions-and-pings-1.png"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Australia, and Asia may get 500 &ndash; 200 ping with Europe+North Africa/America regions. It always has been like that but at least the pings have the potential to be way better than the peer-to-peer version. I expect server coverage for every region so low pings are guaranteed, except the south African region which has been challenging for them to get any multiplayer coverage in the last years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Would there be live profile stats for players on the internet?</h2><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-913 size-full" src="" alt="live game stats for aoe 2 de" width="479" height="448" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png 479w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287-342x320.png 342w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png"></p><p>Yes, It&rsquo;s entirely possible to have your profile stats saved on your xbox profile, but the question is, have they planned it yet?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Would players be able to fake their ELO?</h2><p><img class="size-large wp-image-915 alignnone" src="" alt="cheating in age of empires 2" width="620" height="395" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-502x320.jpg 502w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-768x490.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193.jpg 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg"></p><p>No! It&rsquo;s almost impossible. The only way to fake ELO is to deliberately cheat to earn ELO, and that should be more challenging than before. With the a presence of a good anticheat, people reporting and the live game stats; cheaters would be caught like rats in a trap.</p><h2></h2><h2>Irrelevant to multiplayer, but do I need a bigger monitor to see the game zoomed out?</h2><p><img class="size-large wp-image-917 alignnone" src="" alt="age of empires 2 definitive x4 zoom" width="620" height="345" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-1024x569.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-576x320.jpg 576w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-768x427.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-1024x569.jpg"></p><p>No, You don&rsquo;t! Any laptop or screen profits from x4 zoom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope I have answered as many questions as possible. Feel free to ask more in the comment section and I will answer them for you.</p></p>

Client Server network result ==&gt; <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player is enjoying game after another without any lag impact from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>the lagger.</p><p>Explanation: Actions and commands executed by both players <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>and <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> are decided by the server; therefore, <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> will have a clear advantage over <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>if ever the game goes down to micro.</p><h3>Who wins?</h3><p>To conclude, Client Server multiplayer rewards players with good internet connection and decent computer. Peer-to-Peer punishes all players when one of players is lagging.</p><p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Client Server wins.</span></strong></p><p>We will soon find out later today on E3 Expo&hellip;</p><h3>Good News and Conclusion</h3><p>As of today and after 4 days, It has been confirmed by <a href="https://www.aoezone.net/threads/june-12-17-45-gmt-aoe2-de-first-live-stream-with-cysion.156330/page-3#post-621888" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cysion in this post</a> that Age of Empires 2 DE will be getting Client Server multiplayer. Finally we can put the struggle of those laggy multiplayer behind us.</p></p>

</p><p>Tip: Fletching, Bodkin Arrow, and Bracer also provide additional range for units and buildings.</p><h2>What Blacksmith Upgrades Should you Research First?</h2><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Archery Unit</strong></span> are favored with a priority to Attack Upgrades e.g Fletching, Bodkin and Bracer (<img src="" alt="fletching" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_fletching.jpg"><img src="" alt="bodkin arrow" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_bodkin-arrow.jpg"><img src="" alt="bracer" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_bracer.jpg">) are more important than any Armor upgrades.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Why?</strong> Non-upgraded Archery units initially have less attack and are usually created in large numbers thus attack upgrades will double their damage input however armor upgrades have secondary priority. Attack upgrades for archery units also provide an additional range giving these units an offensive opportunity from further distances.</p></blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Cavalry Unit</strong></span> are favored with a priority to Armor Upgrades e.g. Scale Barding, Chain Barding and Plate Barding (<img src="" alt="scale barding armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_scale-barding-armor.jpg"><img src="" alt="chain barding armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_chain-barding-armor.jpg"><img src="" alt="plate barding armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_plate-barding-armor.jpg">) are more important than any Attack upgrades.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Why?</strong> Cavalry units tank a lot of damage from arrows thus it makes more sense to upgrade armors first so they tank even more damage.</p></blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Infantry Unit</span></strong> are favored with a priority to Armor Upgrades e.g. Scale Mail, Chain Mail, and Plate Mail (<img src="" alt="scale mail amor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_scale-mail-amor.jpg"><img src="" alt="chain mail armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_chain-mail-armor.jpg"><img src="" alt="plate mail armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_plate-mail-armor.jpg">) are more crucial than any attack upgrades.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Why?</strong> Infantry units are initially weaker against archers and upgraded cavalry that is why upgrading armors should increase their resistance therefore more damage is dealt.</p>
