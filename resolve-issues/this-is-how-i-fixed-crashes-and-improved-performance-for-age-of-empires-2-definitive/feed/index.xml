Hello Jay,

Very good description of the issue. Please start by updating sound drivers to the latest if it doesn&#039;t help try switch them to recommended factory version. Some sound card may not work on windows 11 yet so maybe downgrading to windows 10 could help the sound driver to operate the best. Trust me, huge part of your problem is sound, so do your best to investigate everything that is sound related, such as unplug bluetooth headset or use an external sound card usb (costs $2) then plug your audio devices into it. 

If you are still lost come to my discord channel and tag me my id is GregStein#2970 and this my channel: https://discord.gg/cYxUn9WrDF]]></description>

Hello friend,

Sorry for the late response. You could run AoE2 DE through MS Store then open Task manager on the &quot;Details&quot; Tab find AoE2 DE exe then right click it &gt; Locate file and that should send you directly into the correct location of the exe.

If you can&#039;t see the exe file after attempting to locating it I recommend you to use these registry hacks through cmd (run as admin) https://superuser.com/questions/1151844/how-to-toggle-show-hide-hidden-files-in-windows-through-command-line]]></description>

You have a memory leak from using overlays software. Please disable steam overlay and GeForce Experience overlay and discord overlay. I would even go a step forward and disable Windows Defender completely (temporarily).

Anyhow here is my discord: GregStein#2970 Feel free to contact me to investigate with you more]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello GregStein, i recently bought myself a desktop computer. It has the following components:

- AMD Ryzen 7 5800x 8-core
- AMD Radeon 6600 XT
- SSD

The problem is that when I play, be it multiplayer or single player, I start to lose frames. I already saw several ways to fix it with Vsync, but nothing works. It is not an internet issue, since when I play with the notebook I have no problem, besides that I also have the same problem in simple player. Can you guide me on how to solve it?]]></description>
