Hello Jay,

Very good description of the issue. Please start by updating sound drivers to the latest if it doesn&#039;t help try switch them to recommended factory version. Some sound card may not work on windows 11 yet so maybe downgrading to windows 10 could help the sound driver to operate the best. Trust me, huge part of your problem is sound, so do your best to investigate everything that is sound related, such as unplug bluetooth headset or use an external sound card usb (costs $2) then plug your audio devices into it. 

If you are still lost come to my discord channel and tag me my id is GregStein#2970 and this my channel: https://discord.gg/cYxUn9WrDF]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If only there was one more BAT file to categorize the files. Do you have a chart or anything that says files 100-200 are Frank lines or something?
Or even just identifying the most popular sounds by number? Anything?]]></description>

Hello friend,

Sorry for the late response. You could run AoE2 DE through MS Store then open Task manager on the &quot;Details&quot; Tab find AoE2 DE exe then right click it &gt; Locate file and that should send you directly into the correct location of the exe.

If you can&#039;t see the exe file after attempting to locating it I recommend you to use these registry hacks through cmd (run as admin) https://superuser.com/questions/1151844/how-to-toggle-show-hide-hidden-files-in-windows-through-command-line]]></description>
