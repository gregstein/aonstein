Thanks Haris! When i&#039;m walled up and playing against cavalry civs,my response is 3 archery ranges (or 4 archery ranges as huns) + Ballistics work wonders &lt;strong&gt;[mass archers or cavalry archers nonstop. That&#039;s the answer to your question]&lt;/strong&gt;.And when I start dealing serious damage to the enemy&#039;s eco and cut off his knights only then I start adding tcs to prepare for knight transition or siege push or an all in castle age. You&#039;ll know what works best for you based on what the enemy has or is doing.

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you overwhelm him with archers or cavalry archers he usually switches to elite skirm. Therefore, a siege push with rams and mangonels is the best choice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you cut off his army but his economy is nearly untouched switching to knights + ca or xbow is the best call + Expand your eco without investing in tcs because he has no threatening army to raid you with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your castle push is not doing enough or little damage then forget about tcs and spam more units until you overspam him and kill a chunk of his eco.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The best tip i could give you is to scout his base better than scouting yourself in dark age/feudal age. That way you can attack him from different and multiple angles he would never expect or distract him from one angle and do damage from the other.

When the game swings to imperial age, remember that capped (siege) rams + armor upgraded pikes (halbs) is one of the strongest and most disgusting combos that neither archery or cavalry civilizations can deal with it so don&#039;t be afraid of planning this switch before imperial age you&#039;ll be surprised.

You have to ask yourself this how are you ever going to learn if you do not lose and take risks? Then later reflect on your decisions so next time you do it better or differently.]]></description>

Hello ramlal,

Lower your desktop resolution to 800x600 and the game should work. if you switch to play at higher resolutions as far as I have tried last year with age of empires rise of rome there is a patch called UPatch HD just google it, download it and install it (the patch will not work if you have a portable version of the game you need to have rise of rome installed through the setup file). ]]></description>

I just did my &quot;SFX.bnk&quot; following the tutorial and everything converted instantly. Did you forget to put your .bnk file in &quot;1- Extract SFX.bat&quot; or your antivirus blocked/deleted something? Are you on windows 10 ?

Don&#039;t forget that you *.ogg files can&#039;t be played by regular video/audio players. Audacity is a light program and does that for you.]]></description>
