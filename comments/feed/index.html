					<description><![CDATA[I wish to share my experience here and maybe help some people. I had crashes on AoE2 DE on a regular basis, usually 25-30 min into a game, but not always. I am using a external screen plugged to my laptop through a docking station. And that seems to be where the issue came from. I didn&#039;t have these crashes before I used an external screen, and plugging my screen directly to the laptop fixed the issue, is also fixed crashes on other games.]]></description>
