At 31 pop you will have 5 idle shephards move them to chop a nearby tree then farm until 8 farms. 1 New and last villager goes to Gold Then Click Feudal Age at 32 pop.[/su_box]</p><h3>Economical Explained</h3><p>Playing economical is a semi-defensive play-style. You focus on your economy and economy upgrades than on spamming army or blacksmith upgrades.</p><p>A few important basics to perfect an economical style:</p><ul>
<li>Build 2 additional Town Centers</li>
<li>Do not rush blacksmith upgrades yet</li>
<li>Spend most of your wood on farms</li>
<li>Reach at least 28 or 30 farms at 30 mins</li>
</ul><h3>All-in Explained</h3><p>Playing an All-in usually means a mini-boom into a nonstop Castle age army production.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Q:</span> <strong>What&rsquo;s a mini-boom?</strong></p><p><span style="color: #008000;">A:</span> It is a One TC boom consisting of 24 Farmers and more and 12 gold miners and more. When I say &ldquo;and more&rdquo; meaning you need to balance your economy to have consistent food and gold income.</p><p>A few important basics to perfect an All-in:</p><ul>
<li>Do not build extra Town Centers yet</li>
<li>Spend wood on farms and military buildings</li>
<li>Have at least 24 farmers before 19 mins and rally new villagers to gold or wood depending on your needs.</li>
<li>Fully upgrade your army and force engagements or trades.</li>
</ul><h3>Analysis</h3><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Feudal Age goals&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/techtree_feudal-age-e1588064453536.png&rdquo; icon_color=&rdquo;#8a3830&Prime;][/su_service]</p><p>Queue 3 villagers, build a stable and Blacksmith. Soon your forage bushes will deplete then send those foragers to build a new lumbercamp and chop trees. Once Clicking up to Castle Age, Upgrade:</p><ul>
<li>[su_service title=&rdquo;Double-Bit Axe&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/doublebit-axe.jpg&rdquo; icon_color=&rdquo;#8a3830&Prime; size=&rdquo;24&Prime;][/su_service]</li>
<li>[su_service title=&rdquo;Horse Collar&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/horse-collar.jpg&rdquo; icon_color=&rdquo;#8a3830&Prime; size=&rdquo;24&Prime;][/su_service]</li>
</ul><p>Then build a second stable as soon as 175 wood is available.</p><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Castle Age goals&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/techtree_castle-age-e1588064509245.png&rdquo; icon_color=&rdquo;#8a3830&Prime;][/su_service]</p><p>Watching the build order you have noticed how I only upgraded bloodlines for knights. I did not bother to research anything at the blacksmith. Because playing economical you better make army instead of investing on upgrades. Besides you need food to have consistent villager production at your 3 town centers. Later on it is only easier to research any upgrade if you have a decent economy.</p><p>Notice how I did not over build military structures instead I focused on the <strong>build order objective</strong> which is reaching 30 farmers at 30 mins. And around 28 &ndash; 30 mins do not forget to research Handcart because of this latter your imperial age timing would be way faster and your economy gets a significant boost.</p><p>Before reaching Imperial age make sure to continue queuing villagers and fully upgrade your army and add extra military buildings because this is where the economical style shines. You will have all the resources to out-spam your opponent.</p><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Imperial Age Goals&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/techtree_imperial-age.png&rdquo; icon_color=&rdquo;#8a3830&Prime;][/su_service]</p><p>At Imperial your life becomes much easier as you reserve the freedom to do whatever army you wish. However I recommend you to build a few siege workshops then make those capped rams to help you destroy your opponent Castles and whatever structures in the way.</p></p>

</p><p><span style="color: #008000;">A:</span> Scout rush usually hits your base at 12:30 or 13 mins with 3 &ndash; 4 scouts. You will need 1 or 2 spears at all vulnerable spots. For example I like to have:</p><ul>
<li>Gold Miners guarded by: <strong>2 Spears</strong></li>
<li>Lumberjacks guarded by: <strong>1 Spear</strong> at 12 mins then <strong>2 Spears</strong> at 13&rsquo;ish mins ( Use your villagers to attack enemy scouts along with your spears)</li>
<li>Foragers can be easily sent back to Town Center or use the <strong>same spears</strong> from your wood line.</li>
</ul><h4>Two Rules to follow in order to take less damage possible from scout rush</h4><ol>
<li>Never chase 3 or 4 scouts with 1 Spear (Unless most of them are low hp)</li>
<li>Always send at least 2 spear-men with your archers to attack the enemy before castle age.</li>

</p><p><span style="color: #339966;">A:</span> You can engage only if they don&rsquo;t have +1 Attack (Fletching) while you have it. To find out, click an enemy Skirmisher and check if his attack is only 2 (not 2 + 1) because 2 + 1 means he has fletching . See image below (You can use high ground and hills to gain an extra +1 attack when fighting enemy army)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: What If my opponent has many skirmishers while I&rsquo;m going up to Castle Age?</span></p><p><img class=" wp-image-1062 alignnone" src="" alt="Counter Skirmishers with Knights or Mangonels" width="428" height="182" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/countering-skirms.jpg"></p><p><span style="color: #339966;">A:</span> At 50% Before hitting Castle Age, sneak in 2 villagers to build a siege workshop near your enemy base. Use Mangonels to land some good shots or scare him away. Meantime your Crossbows are picking off villagers. Or instead of building a siege workshop you can build a stable and make 2 knights to clean all the skirmishers.</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: What if my opponent is fully walled since feudal age and has stables?</span></p><p><img class="wp-image-1063 alignnone" src="" alt="walled enemy" width="505" height="262" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy-617x320.jpg 617w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy-768x398.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy.jpg"></p><p><span style="color: #339966;">A:</span> Stables usually mean knights play. To counter that you must decide whether you go for an all-in or economic style. I will explain them both:</p><p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">All-in Style? </span>(No additional Town Centers but continue farming and building army and villagers non-stop</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p>Build a second barracks once you click up to Castle Age and queue both archers and spears. Research Plate armor for spears. Once you reach Castle Age, upgrade to Pikeman and Crossbows simultaneously.</p><p>Go forward with your army and 2 villagers then build a siege workshop near your enemy base and force fights and take down military buildings using rams or Mangonels. Preferably ram down Town centers if you can. <span style="color: #008000;">Most importantly never stop making army until you win or get significantly ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_5]</p><p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Economic Style? </span>(Add 2 extra Town Centers and prioritize economic tasks and upgrades over military until you have enough villagers to support whatever plan you have in mind.)</strong></p><p>Once you reach Castle Age; upgrade to Crossbowmen; Build a monastery and 2 Town Centers. Use monks to convert his knights or scare him away. If the enemy builds a siege workshop you also build a defensive siege workshop. <span style="color: #008000;">Focus your energy on improving your economy and queuing more villagers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If he commits to knights you can either build an extra archery range and a university to research Ballistics then start sniping his knights one by one. Or Switch to Pikemen to defend your base and go up to imperial age first. At Imperial Age, if you civilization has access to Arbalests it&rsquo;ll be just easier to end up the game. Or Halberdiers Or Unique units or Paladins.. Whatever your civilization excels at use it.</p><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;The Economic Style is the universal go and safe against all civilizations.

<li>Killing 1 enemy gold miner is better than killing 1 lumberjack.</li>
</ul><h4>2- Force Enemy to Build defenses</h4><p><img class=" wp-image-1052 alignnone" src="" alt="force the enemy to build defences" width="417" height="250" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/force-enemy-build-defences.jpg 561w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/force-enemy-build-defences-534x320.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/force-enemy-build-defences.jpg"></p><p>Yet another trick to set your enemy behind is to force him to:</p><ul>
<li>Build a defensive Tower ( Later in castle age he can&rsquo;t build town centers which forces him to mine stone too and that is good for you)</li>
<li>Build Skirmishers &amp; Spears ( The more skirmishers/spears the enemy makes the more delayed to Castle age he will be. Simply go Castle age faster for the win)</li>
</ul><h4>3- Keep fights away from Your Town</h4><p><img class=" wp-image-1053 alignnone" src="" alt="Fighting near enemy base" width="473" height="283" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fighting-in-enemy-base.jpg 561w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fighting-in-enemy-base-534x320.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fighting-in-enemy-base.jpg"></p><p>I can not stress enough on the cruciality of initiating fights or engaging fights while at your opponent base or away from your own base. That way and first of all in case things go wrong enemy units can&rsquo;t rush into your base straight up in one glimpse of an eye. Then second You can split your army to cause chaos.</p><h5>A little distraction</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1054 alignnone" src="" alt="2 Archers behind a wood line" width="477" height="249" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/archers-behind-wood-line.jpg 750w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/archers-behind-wood-line-614x320.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/archers-behind-wood-line.jpg"></p><p>Put <span style="color: #339966;">1 or 2 archers behind his wood line</span> somewhere it takes him time to reach while you attack gold miners or farmers. If he chases your army and ignores that 1 or 2 archers; at that point your 1 or 2 archers have overdone their work.</p><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;In case you have a bigger army, You rather split it to attack different resources than to attack one single resource.&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;icon: tipeee&rdquo; icon_color=&rdquo;#e44144&Prime; size=&rdquo;28&Prime;][/su_service]</p><h3>Greedy &amp; Cheesy Versions of 23 Pop Archers</h3><h4>18, 19 or 20 Pop Archers</h4><p><img class="size-full wp-image-1068 alignnone" src="" alt="18 19 or 20 pop feudal age" width="162" height="165" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18-19-20pop.jpg"></p><p>Some Civilizations get to Feudal age faster than the rest. For example:</p><ul>
<li><strong> Mongols:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18, 19 or 20 pop. Food is gathered 40% faster from Boars/Deers or any hunted animals .</li>
<li><strong>Britons:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18 or 19 pop. Sheep and goats food is gathered 25% faster <del>not turkeys or Cows</del>.</li>
<li><strong>Khmer:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 19 or 20 pop then skip building Barracks to build double archery ranges instead.</li>
<li><strong>Lithuanians:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18 or 19 pop due to +150 Dark Age food bonus.</li>
<li><strong>Huns:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 19 pop and since they do not need houses you will save up enough wood for Archery Ranges.</li>
<li><strong>Malay:</strong> Can click Feudal Age as late as 22 pop yet They reach Feudal age 66% faster. And that counts as 20 pop.</li>
<li><strong>Indians:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18 or 19 pop as villagers are cheaper to create.</li>
<li><strong>Italian: </strong>Can click Feudal Age with only 435 Food around 19 pop</li>
</ul><h4>Sneaky Archery Ranges</h4><p><img class=" wp-image-1064 alignnone" src="" alt="sneaky archery ranges" width="469" height="313" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-479x320.jpg 479w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-768x513.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers.jpg 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-1024x684.jpg"></p><p>The idea is as simple as it sounds. Send two villagers forward to build double archery ranges behind, right or left hand side your opponent. Be as stealthy as you can in order to catch your enemy off guard with an early 6 archers with Fletching.</p><p>If you are caught in the process of building the archery ranges well that could be pickle to deal with. Often the enemy will pull villagers to wall in your archery ranges or tower them. Or they can respond with an early Archery range and counter you with 6 to 11 skirmishers then go up to castle age faster than you.</p><p>In this situation, you are looking at one option:&nbsp; Full Feudal Age war. Send 3 villagers to stone and build a stable then mix in both archers and skirmishers + scouts and build towers as soon as you bank 125 stone. To succeed with your Full Feudal war you must over farm and focus on Food and Wood resources primarily. Meaning..</p><ul>
<li>Do not exceed 4 Stone miners</li>
<li>Do not exceed 4 to 6 Gold Miners</li>
</ul><h4>Benchmarks For Raiding Your Opponent</h4><h5>Tiny Attack (2 Archers + 2 Spears)</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1065 alignnone" src="" alt="2 archers and 2 spears tiny rush" width="346" height="172" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-archers-2-spears.jpg"></p><p>At 12:00 &ndash; 12:30 mins, This tiny attack is meant to stop an opponent from walling or idle his economy a little too early. It is most effective against a Scout rush build. Most importantly, DO NOT lose this tiny army trying to get 1 kill. We have discussed previously that idling enemy villagers is more worthy than killing 1 or 2 villagers.</p><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Forget about Kills! Focus on Idling Economy.&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;icon: tipeee&rdquo; icon_color=&rdquo;#e44144&Prime; size=&rdquo;28&Prime;][/su_service]</p><h5>Small Attack (6 &ndash; 8 Archers)</h5><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1066 " src="" alt="6 archers + fletching being researched" width="328" height="215" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-archers.jpg"></p><p>Around 14:30 mins, you should move out with 6 archers (+2 spears against Scouts play). You must focus this small attack on enemy gold miners but if you can not only then attack his lumberjacks or farmers. Do not over stay if the enemy has army of his own. Again it&rsquo;s not worth to lose your army for 2 kills; However forcing him to hide villagers for a few seconds then run away is&nbsp; mostly worth it.</p><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Use Hit and Run tactics. Sneak your archers from different angles and corners. Get kills when you can. Try to keep your army as alive as you can.&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;icon: tipeee&rdquo; icon_color=&rdquo;#e44144&Prime; size=&rdquo;28&Prime;][/su_service]</p><h5>Main Attack ( 12 &ndash; 20)</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1067 alignnone" src="" alt="19 archers" width="482" height="385" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19-archers.jpg 666w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19-archers-401x320.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19-archers.jpg"></p><p>By <strong>17:00 mins</strong>, your army count should be over 12 archers and&hellip; Have you saved those <strong>6 &ndash; 8 Archers</strong> from the previous small attack? That would make your army even stronger and larger in number. If necessary you can go for the Padded Archer Armor upgrade to improve the resistance of your archers against enemy units such as Skirmishers and Scouts.</p><ul>
<li>Against a greedy and walled enemy you can split your army then attack from different angles as long as he does not have a scary army to cut you off with.</li>
<li>Against an enemy with a considerable army size or a combo of archers and scouts. You must be cautious not to walk into your death by shoving your army without scouting information about where enemy army is located. In fact I would recommend you to focus on idling your town center to save up enough food to go up to Castle Age. Once at Castle Age first; feel free to shove into your opponent base with crossbowmen and micro your way in.</li>
</ul><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Losing your archers before Castle age is a suicide. Rather wait to upgrade to Crossbowmen to deal maximum damage.&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;icon: tipeee&rdquo; icon_color=&rdquo;#e44144&Prime; size=&rdquo;28&Prime;][/su_service]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Tips</h2><p>23 Pop Archers is certainly a viable build order in any tier or skill level. Just learn to do some efficient walling to be ready against the worst of it. Do not forget that the biggest point of weakness of this build is<strong> Gold Miners.&nbsp;</strong>Build your military structures in front of your gold mines and prioritize protection first and foremost to your gold miners. Then your Woodline.</p><p>One more tip, watch replays you lost and talk to yourself what you could have done better. Because next time you will react to those situation without second thoughts.</p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you new to a scout rush? Looking to improve it? This guide will not only teach how to scout rush properly but also unveil the deepest dark secrets of a scout rush in step by step guide.<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how low or high your ELO.

It is a 21 or 22 population build that replies on two main resources: Wood and Food.</p><h2>Can I Scout Rush with all Civilizations?</h2><p>No! Preferably only civilizations with an access to &ldquo;bloodlines&rdquo; (available at the stable); and these are the civilizations you can scout rush with:</p><p>[su_table]</p><table>

It can also be a 21 pop; all you have to do is cut down villager production at 21 pop to research loom instead.</p><h3>The Scout Rush Goals</h3><p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the scout rush is one of the safest and economic build orders in the game. Yet it can get tricky at some situations where you don&rsquo;t know what kind of damage you are looking to do or in other words what&rsquo;s the scout rush &ldquo;Goal&rdquo; or purpose in a particular situation.</p><p>I have compiled a list of things you should try to pull with a scout rush. Try to at least accomplish <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>4 of these goals in your game</strong></span>; only then you have reached the scout rush goal.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Scout the base of an enemy as good as you can (find his main gold patch, wood patch, stone patches as that would help you find different locations from where you could attack him).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Deny/kill enemy Wallers/Builders</strong></li>
<li><strong>Kill/Idle as many enemy villagers as possible especially between 12 &ndash; 16 mins</strong></li>
<li><strong>Force an enemy to make more than 2 spearmen early in feudal age</strong></li>
<li><strong>Delay enemy gold miners for at least 1 &ndash; 2 mins</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reduce/Kill the army of an enemy once he moves out of his base</strong></li>
<li><strong>Force an enemy to put a tower in any of his resources</strong></li>
<li><strong>Force an enemy to mine stone</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interrupt/kill enemy Farmers constantly</strong></li>
</ul><p>In case you haven&rsquo;t notice, most of these goals aim to <strong><span style="color: #008000;">delay</span></strong> the enemy from going to castle age. As a result, your &ldquo;Scout Rush&rdquo; benefits from a better economy and potentially early castle age army technology.</p><h3>Scout Rush Secret Blueprint</h3><p>This is the core part of this step by step guide and I highly recommend you to remember this blueprint that I&rsquo;m about to share with you.</p><p><strong>This blueprint begins at Feudal Age</strong></p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-511" src="" alt="scout rush blueprint" width="485" height="510" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blueprint-scout-rush.jpg 485w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blueprint-scout-rush-304x320.jpg 304w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blueprint-scout-rush.jpg"></p><h3></h3><h3>Take an Advantage over an Advantage</h3><p>Nobody might have told you this before probably they don&rsquo;t want you to know about it or they just are doing it subconsciously without knowing.</p><p>The idea of taking an advantage over another advantage is to be aware when you get a specific advantage and know how to turn that small window of opportunity to significant chance of winning the game.</p><p>Here are some good examples of taking an advantage over an advantage in a scout rush:</p><p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you executed your scout rush very well to the point where suddenly the enemy lost all his army to your scouts as early as 15 &ndash; 17 mins =&gt;&nbsp; This is your First advantage.</p><p>Take note of the benchmark between 15 &ndash; 17 mins. At this moment you can take this small window of opportunity where the enemy has no army and for example bring a forward villager/villagers to build a tower/towers in the weakest point of his map (behind his lumberjacks, behind his gold miners or behind his farmers) while you keep the production of whatever unit you can. I recommend delaying or stopping his gold miners as that might just be a game ender.</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p><p>An enemy tower rush is failing while you managed to hold position by counter towering him 2 times at least =&gt; This is your First advantage.</p><p>Your Over Advantage =&gt;&nbsp; Send 5 &ndash; 7 villagers forward and tower rush his wood line at any expense while you are assigning new villagers to wood and make farms at 60 wood (use all your wood on farms at least 17 farms).</p><p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p><p>An enemy drush (3 militias) bumped into your Town center and died or (1,2 militias) survived with few hp =&gt;&nbsp; This is your First advantage.</p><p>There is always a reason why an enemy would Drush (You should scout his base):</p><ul>
<li>An enemy was drushing&hellip; <span style="color: #800000;">To gain time to wall his base/Fast castle</span>: Your Over Advantage =&gt; Make a transition to a tower rush instead of a scout rush and send 5 villagers forward to tower his gold miners/lumberjacks and why not break into his walls and make more towers whilst you are farming constantly and mining gold as soon as 14 mins</li>
<li>An enemy was drushing&hellip; <span style="color: #800000;">To transition to Archers/Men at arms</span>: Your Over Advantage =&gt; Execute your scout rush as normal as you do (add only 2 scouts and go attack and scout) And build an archery range at 12 ish min and add skirmishers to counter enemy archers while you farm all the way to 14 &ndash; 16 farms. Most importantly play defensive with the skirmishers on one side while you wall/outposts the other sides</li>
</ul><p>Those are just a few out of many examples of how to take an advantage over an advantage. Watch your recorded games to learn where you could have taken an advantage over another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How to play Scout Rush against other strategies?</h3><p>Due to the importance of this section I found myself obliged to enclose recorded games whenever possible besides elaborating every move you should do and how to setup your economy along the way.</p><h4>Scout Rush Vs Drush/Archers</h4><p>I cannot emphasis enough the <a title="3 Effective Ways of Scouting in Age Of Empires 2" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/scout-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">importance of scouting your enemy</a>. If you suck at scouting you should practice it every day and at least 5 games.</p><p>How to find out if your enemy is going to Drush into archers?</p><p><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span> Commonly 27 &ndash; 28 pop including 3 militias, maximum 3 farmers.</p><ul>
<li>Barracks being built at 6:10 &ndash; 6:50 min.</li>
<li>One of the gold patches (800 gold) is missing 10 gold (790 gold).</li>
<li>Any Dead body of a wolf on explored areas of the map</li>
</ul><p>You have learnt the signs now right? Now would you defend a drush into archers?</p><p><strong>Let&rsquo;s divide the question to two parts:</strong></p><h5>How to defend against a drush?</h5><p>[su_frame align=&rdquo;center&rdquo;]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-518" src="" alt="quick wall example in age of empires 2" width="546" height="359" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/quick-wall-foragers.jpg 546w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/quick-wall-foragers-487x320.jpg 487w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/quick-wall-foragers.jpg">[/su_frame]</p><p>A Drush usually hits your base at 9:30 min. So even if you didn&rsquo;t scout it but you know that your enemy is Drushing; you can just start surrounding your lumberjacks and foragers with unfinished palisade walls &ndash; this trick is called &ldquo;quick walls&rdquo;. Use this trick around 8:30 min because you have already clicked feudal age and so it is easier to do for both lumber camps and mill at the same time.</p><p>If the militias attack an unfinished palisade wall you just finish building it and repairing it.</p><p><strong>But what if you fail to quick wall?</strong></p><p><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span> Just have your villagers stacked on a tree or on a forage bush and when the militias approach you simply <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>aim and attack one militia at the time and if you manage to kill one militia the threat is reduced</strong></span> (Do not follow his militias, if they run don&rsquo;t chase them until you have scouts out)</p><h5></h5><h5>What army should I do in feudal age to counter enemy archers transition?</h5><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">Feudal Age</span>: Build a Stable</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">While Building Stable</span>: Set a goal (in your mind) of how many farms you should make (14 or 16 farmers)</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">Stable built</span>: Add 2 &ndash; 3 scouts</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">12:30 min</span>: Build an Archery range with 2 villagers.</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">Archery range built</span>: Add Skirmishers</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">14:30 min</span>: build a blacksmith with 1 villager.</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blacksmith built</span>: Research Fletching</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">Fletching researched</span>: engage any fight with archers and try to reduce/kill them.

If you still have skirmishers I recommend that you build the second stable and get both elite skirmishers and knights. But if the enemy has many archers, an additional archery range might help you catch up with him and add elite skirms to push him back. A forward or defensive siege workshop and make a mangonel is also a good idea as you might get a lucky shot on those crossbows.</p><p><strong>Example Recorded Game of how to counter a Drush into archers (Scouts into 3 ranges skirm into cavalry archers) on any land map generation</strong></p><p>[su_button url=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Scout-Rush-Vs-Drush.zip&rdquo; radius=&rdquo;0&Prime;]Download an&nbsp; (Userpatch 1.5 RC)[/su_button]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example Recorded Game of how to counter a Drush into archers (Faster Castle Age Timing) on a wallable map by Jeowaypoint</strong></p><p>[su_button url=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Scout_Rush_Vs_DrushFC-fullwallednot_much_army_sc-FC_knt.zip&rdquo; radius=&rdquo;0&Prime;]Download&nbsp; (Userpatch 1.5 RC)[/su_button]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example Recorded Game of how to counter a Drush into archers (Scouts into 1 range skirms 2 stables knights ) on a wallable map by Jeowaypoint</strong></p><p>[su_button url=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Scout_Rush_Vs_DrushArch_-_scouts_to_skirms_1range_to_2StKnt-22min_Up.zip&rdquo; radius=&rdquo;0&Prime;]Download&nbsp; (Userpatch 1.5 RC)[/su_button]</p><h4></h4><h4>Scout Rush Vs Drush/Fast Castle</h4><p><span style="color: #993300;">What are the signs of a Drush FC?</span></p><ul>
<li>7 &ndash; 8 farms</li>
<li>4 farms and deers under the town center</li>
<li>Early blacksmith</li>
<li>Fully walled and reached feudal age around 12:30 ish min</li>
<li>Late to Feudal age 12:40 &ndash; 13 ish min and stone miners</li>
</ul><p>(In the previous section &ldquo;Scout Rush Vs Drush/Archers&rdquo; I have tackled how to defend a Drush. Same thing applies here.)</p><p>So if you scout any of the signs above only then your <strong>goal</strong> is quite simple:</p><p>Your first priority is to pressure his <strong>gold miners. </strong>Do whatever you can to stop him from mining gold. Pressuring his wood line or farmers has a secondary priority.</p><p>Below is only the economical Build order. Check out reactions afterwards for what army composition you should be going for.</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">Feudal Age</span>: research double axe/horse collar and start farming until 14 &ndash; 17 farms</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">Upgrades Researched</span>: Scout the enemy to find any sign of a Drush FC</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">Any Drush FC sign found</span>: Follow the reactions I will be listing below this build order.</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">14 ish min</span>: Research wheelbarrow and send 4 villagers mine gold</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">16 ish min</span>: You should have around 14 &ndash; 17 farmers and the rest of the villagers (after reaching the farms goal) as gold miners</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">17 ish min</span>: Build a market and sell wood or food for 200 gold (if low on gold) and go up around 17 &ndash; 18:30 ish min mark.</p><p>@ <span style="color: #0000ff;">18 &ndash; 19 min</span>: Click Castle Age</p><p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Reactions To Drush FC</span></strong></p><p>We have talked earlier about reactions. Your <strong>reactions</strong> in this situation should be:</p><ul>
<li>One of the signs of Drush FC + Archery Range <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>=&gt;</strong></span> Build Archery range, add skirms, send a few villagers forward, mine stone and keep trushing him while you assist with skirms and spearmen if needed. Build a blacksmith at 14:30 min.</li>
<li>One of the signs of Drush FC + Stable <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>=&gt;</strong></span> Only add spearmen, send a few villagers forward, mine stone and keep trushing him while you assist with spearmen</li>
<li>One of the signs of Drush FC + Market/Blacksmith + His civilization has a good Unique Unit (e.g. Spanish, Goths, Portuguese, Mayans, Burmese, Mongols, Koreans, Berbers, Turks, Vietnamese) <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>=&gt;</strong></span> If His Map is Bad <strong>then</strong> Tower rush him as that might pan out well. Else If his map is good and his resources are in the back and he is fully walled <strong>then</strong> stone wall yourself and prepare a good counter army while you are macroing behind it (additional 2 town centers and farms, farms.. Reach 30 farms at 30 mins to go up to imperial as soon as 32 &ndash; 33 &ndash; 34 min mark. But If you want to make a mid castle age full push &lsquo;Mini Boom&rsquo; it&rsquo;s usually around 24 &ndash; 25 min with 25 farms then you can make army non-stop&hellip; I will talk about all this in another tutorial soon).</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your army does not have to be huge early castle age if you are planning to go imperial faster &mdash; e.g enemy civilization is Burmese and the unique unit is &ldquo;Arambai&rdquo; you can defend by building one monastery and adding monks to convert them. When you see the enemy making a siege workshop instantly react to that by building your own siege workshop and queue mangonels. Meantime you are building a solid economy (30 farms at 30 mins).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This imagery explains how to counter Drush FC units with a minimal army while you build up a good economy</p><p>[su_frame align=&rdquo;center&rdquo;]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-514" src="" alt="minimal counters to drush fc" width="415" height="380" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/minimal-counters.jpg 415w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/minimal-counters-349x320.jpg 349w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/minimal-counters.jpg">[/su_frame]</p><h4>Scout Rush Vs Forward</h4><p><span style="color: #993300;">What are the signs of a Forward?</span></p><ul>
<li>8:30 &ndash; 9 min villagers walking towards your town</li>
<li>No Military buildings at his base</li>
<li>Enemy Villagers building a barracks/archery range nearby your town</li>
<li>Any Dead body of a wolf on explored areas of the map</li>
</ul><p>When you find out your opponent is forwarding you here&rsquo;s what you should do:</p><p>Locate his forward villagers are and count them. If they are 5 villagers then send 5+2 villagers of your own and try to gang attack villager by villager.</p><p>If enemy villagers are supplemented with militias, you must <strong>gang attack</strong> the militias first because they deal 4 damage while villagers only 3 attack. Same thing applies to the feudal scout if the enemy is in feudal age (scout base attack is 5 in feudal age, but 3 in dark age).</p><p>Another game changing micro tip is watching villagers/units hp. Attack the lowest hp villager/unit to reduce the fight efficiency of the enemy. Don&rsquo;t forget to watch your own villagers/units hp &ndash; you should send them back when lower than 12 hp (send a replacement if needed).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The forward has failed the enemy</strong></span></p><p>When the enemy is moving back that can only mean that his forward has failed. Your reaction should not be letting him get away with it &ndash; Do you remember the lesson of taking an advantage over an advantage? &ndash; Well you have had an advantage when the enemy has left your town thus now your over advantage can be as follow:</p><ul>
<li>Go after him and immediately start mining stone (4 stone miners) to build towers to deny him from resources or force another fight with his villagers (run back and come back but don&rsquo;t lose villagers) until you get an opportunity to build a tower both are equally worth it.</li>
<li>Wall in any forward military buildings then plan a heavy scout rush attack while mining stone slowly (only 2 or 3 stone miners) for defensive towers against a potential archer+spear rush.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Scout Rush Vs Trush</h4><p><span style="color: #993300;">What are the signs of a Trush?</span></p><ul>
<li>One Lumber Camp and a few lumberjacks(4 &ndash; 6)</li>
<li>Villagers mining stone at 8 ish min</li>
<li>8:30 &ndash; 9 min villagers walking towards your town</li>
<li>Any Dead body of a wolf on explored areas of the map</li>
</ul><p>I have already written a dedicated guide on <a title="How To Counter A Tower Rush &ldquo;Trush&rdquo;" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/counter-tower-rush-trush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to counter a trush</a> for an optimal understanding of the build order.</p><h4></h4><h4>Scout Rush Vs Scout Rush</h4><p><span style="color: #993300;">What are the signs of a Scout Rush?</span></p><ul>
<li>Two Lumber Camps and 10 &ndash; 11 lumberjacks</li>
<li>Barracks being built at his base as well as a stable later at feudal age.</li>
</ul><p>Mirror build orders such as a scout rush can get tricky if you get out micro-ed by the enemy scouts. Reducing scouts count is your very first priority in this matchup. Because only then you get scouts advantage which at some points you would want to get upgrades to deal significant damage with.</p><p>Essentially there isn&rsquo;t exactly a counter build to a mirror build order but to setup a good defense while you apply a good offence. Sometimes you see players send forward spears to cut down enemy scouts or keep him busy. Other players like to make a scouts and wall up their base go to up to castle first.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see the do and do not in a scout rush mirror build order:</p><p><strong>To Do in a scout fight</strong></p><ul>
<li>Take a fight uphill even if your scout count is less e.g (3) scouts while the enemy is (4) scouts. Aim attack and kill one enemy scout and run away. Can be repeated when you see a chance</li>
<li>Attack the lowest hp enemy scout and micro your own by pulling them when they take much damage.</li>
<li>Engage a fight if you are ahead with upgrades</li>
</ul><p><strong>Not To Do in a scout fight</strong></p><ul>
<li>Do Not take fights down hill</li>
<li>Do Not engage enemy scouts that have bloodlines</li>
<li>Do Not lose scouts to enemy villagers unnecessarily (gives leverage scout count to the enemy)</li>
</ul><p>These were basic and crucial points you must DO and NOT DO.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not it&hellip;</p><p>In this section of a scout rush mirror build order, you should expect different transitions from the opponent:</p><p><span style="color: #993300;">What are the signs of full scouts into knights?</span></p><ul>
<li>One lumber camp and luring deers</li>
<li>Blacksmith at 14:30 &ndash; 15 ish min</li>
<li>Only 2 villagers mining gold</li>
<li>Defensive with only scouts (greedy with spears)</li>
</ul><p><span style="color: #993300;">What are the signs of a few scouts into Castle age cavalry archers/Knights?</span></p><ul>
<li>Early walls with only 3 &ndash; 5 scouts</li>
<li>Blacksmith or market around 16 &ndash; 17 ish mins</li>
<li>Idle Archery Ranges/Stables for a long time in feudal age</li>
</ul><p><span style="color: #993300;">What are the signs of a full feudal rush?</span></p><p>This one is very tricky and the best way find out is to scout the first wave of scouts/archers/spears heading to your town. You can also walk near his military buildings and click them to see where in the mini-map the gather point is set to.</p><p>I have presented to you almost if not all the common strategies that can be pulled out from a scout rush in a mirror build order matchup. Your free pass to getting good at this is scouting and always scouting your enemy. I have omitted the economical setup in this section because everything is already in the blueprint I shared with you in section of &ldquo;Scout Rush Secret Blueprint&rdquo;.</p><p>Now that you have the recipe you can be as creative as you wish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Help &amp; Links</h3><p>Q: How to watch recorded games presented in this tutorial or other guides on this website?</p><p>A: Use AoE2Tools to drag and drop any recorded game after you have selected the respected version. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srhi14fjTkM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutorial Video on how to setup and use AoE2Tools</a></p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter how many hours you spent on playing Age of Empires 2. It just never ceases to be more intriguing, game after game. The amount of fun AOE2 is providing is endless.<p>I am not talking about 31 civilizations including the Dlcs&nbsp;(<a title="Forgotten Empires" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/239550/Age_of_Empires_II_HD_The_Forgotten/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Forgotten Empires</a>, <a title="African Kingdoms" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/355950/Age_of_Empires_II_HD_The_African_Kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">African Kingdoms</a>, <a title="Rise of Rajas" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/488060/Age_of_Empires_II_HD_Rise_of_the_Rajas/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Rise of Rajas</a>). Neither those long entertaining hours on Blackforest.&nbsp; Simply those little tricks you learn if you happen to&nbsp;watch a recorded game, a youtube video or a live-stream.</p><p>So take a seat and grab some popcorn. Because today we are going to be looking at those exclusive and fascinating tricks along with real-time examples.</p><h2>1- Tree Hop</h2><p>Just image your enemy fully walled whereas you have a big&nbsp;army. What are the chances to deal damage if you can NOT get into his base?</p><p>Well! Sometimes, all you need to do is observe. Check if your opponent is forming a wall using a straggler tree.</p><p>If that straggler tree is chopped =&gt; Just build a palisade&nbsp;on top of that tree (without having to actually build it) Then Voila! Get inside your enemy&rsquo;s base.</p><p>if that straggler tree is <strong>NOT</strong> chopped =&gt; Bring a villager to chop the tree and place a palisade on top of it then barge into his base.</p><p>Here are some live examples of a tree hop&nbsp;from multiplayer games:</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube_advanced url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJSvarRkx68&Prime; autohide=&rdquo;yes&rdquo; theme=&rdquo;light&rdquo; https=&rdquo;yes&rdquo;]</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube_advanced url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFsjX0Q207o&rdquo; autohide=&rdquo;yes&rdquo; theme=&rdquo;light&rdquo; https=&rdquo;yes&rdquo;]</p><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?autoplay=false&amp;video=v6643766" width="620" height="378" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><h2>2- Boar save</h2><p>A very useful trick to rescue your villager from dying to a boar. To&nbsp;successfully pull off the &lsquo;boar save&rsquo;, you need to anticipate the &lsquo;spot&rsquo; where a boar will be walking on, then immediately place a house or a palisade wall on that &lsquo;spot&rsquo;.</p><p>Here is a personal example of mine in a multiplayer game to&nbsp;illustrate a boar save:</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube_advanced url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-SEOAB_E28&Prime; autohide=&rdquo;yes&rdquo; theme=&rdquo;light&rdquo; https=&rdquo;yes&rdquo;]</p><p>Have a look at a video made by&nbsp;TheViper explaining how to perform a boar save:</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube_advanced url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZSrEDigO8s&rdquo; autohide=&rdquo;yes&rdquo; theme=&rdquo;light&rdquo; https=&rdquo;yes&rdquo;]</p><h2>3- Palisade Spy</h2><p>This trick is not very common&nbsp;among average to beginner players. It probably may not be useful in the lower league gameplay since aggression is almost absent or delayed.</p><p>Only later on when you have a basic understanding of build orders and <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/beginners/improve-multitasking-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mechanics</a>. This trick will make your life a piece of cake to anticipate what is your enemy is up to; is he making an army?; is he <a title="How To Counter A Tower Rush &ldquo;Trush&rdquo;" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/counter-tower-rush-trush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">towering your wood line</a>?; is he mining gold/stone earlier?</p><p>First off, you should have already explored the area where you are going to lay down palisade walls. Otherwise, you can not do this tricks if you haven&rsquo;t already scouted &lsquo;that area&rsquo;.</p><p>here is an example of palisade spying:</p><p>
<div id="attachment_427" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-427" class="wp-image-427 size-large" src="" alt="palisade spy los age of empires 2" width="620" height="338" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/palisade-laming-age-of-empires-2-1024x559.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/palisade-laming-age-of-empires-2-586x320.jpg 586w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/palisade-laming-age-of-empires-2-768x419.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/palisade-laming-age-of-empires-2.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/palisade-laming-age-of-empires-2-1024x559.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-427" class="wp-caption-text">inbuilt Palisades provide Line of sight. Use that to reveal villagers taking specific resources.</p></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4- Tower Hop</h2><p>Another famous old-school trick that is worth mentioning in this post <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Very common in &lsquo;Arena&rsquo; map. By simply binding a tower to the corner of a wall, you get access to your enemy&rsquo;s town.</p><p><strong>Step One</strong></p><p>
<div id="attachment_428" style="width: 815px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-428" class="size-full wp-image-428" src="" alt="tower hop Age of Empires 2" width="805" height="552" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tower-hop-aoe-2.jpg 805w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tower-hop-aoe-2-467x320.jpg 467w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tower-hop-aoe-2-768x527.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tower-hop-aoe-2.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-428" class="wp-caption-text">Building a tower to perform a hop</p></div>
</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step Two</strong></p><p>
<div id="attachment_429" style="width: 826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-429" class=" wp-image-429" src="" alt="executing tower hop age of empires 2" width="816" height="576" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/executing-tower-hop-age-of-empires-2.jpg 1011w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/executing-tower-hop-age-of-empires-2-454x320.jpg 454w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/executing-tower-hop-age-of-empires-2-768x542.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/executing-tower-hop-age-of-empires-2.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-429" class="wp-caption-text">select the tower and right-click on the enemy&rsquo;s base (1). Then individually in-garrison villagers by clicking the icons 2, 3, 4.</p></div>
</p><p><strong>Step Three</strong></p><p>
<div id="attachment_430" style="width: 822px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-430" class="wp-image-430 " src="" alt="build another tower inside enemy's base" width="812" height="523" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tower-hop-build-another-tower.jpg 970w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tower-hop-build-another-tower-497x320.jpg 497w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tower-hop-build-another-tower-768x495.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tower-hop-build-another-tower.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-430" class="wp-caption-text">Build another tower inside the base of your enemy.</p></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You might want to be careful trying this trick versus decent players since it is likely to fail. Still, It can work versus beginners or players with low knowledge about the game.</p><h2>5- Building Spy</h2><p>Most of you probably don&rsquo;t know about this one&hellip; Did you know that you can see where your enemy&rsquo;s buildings are rallied to?</p><p>Three years ago, I was watching a&nbsp;stream of a Brazilian&nbsp;top player &lsquo;Feage&rsquo;. He was playing a 1v1 matchup against Dogao in islands. Feage found Dogao docks then clicked them. And on the minimap, he could see a cross&nbsp;mark where Dogao&rsquo;s war galleys boats were heading to. Therefore,&nbsp;Feage&nbsp;moved his fishing ships to a safer location.</p><p>This trick works on all the military buildings. I myself use it in Arabia; At Feudal Age,&nbsp;if my enemy is rallying his barracks to my town, It only means that he is going for a spear/scout push.</p><p>Here is an example in 1v1 Arabia:</p><p>

</p><p>A very annoying and lame trick&hellip; It essentially has the potential to hurt the economy of your opponent early on in feudal age.</p><p>
<div id="attachment_437" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-437" class="size-full wp-image-437" src="" alt="Killing 1 hp farm with one hit" width="750" height="475" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/laming-farm-in-age-of-empires-2.jpg 750w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/laming-farm-in-age-of-empires-2-505x320.jpg 505w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/laming-farm-in-age-of-empires-2.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-437" class="wp-caption-text">Killing 1 hp farm with one hit</p></div>
</p><p>Once a farm is laid down (It only has 1 hp) and before the villager&nbsp;begins building it. It can be killed by an enemy unit (e.g. scout); Hence 60 wood is lost too. What if there were more farms laid down?&hellip; That would be your lucky day!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>7- Straggler Trees Laming</h2><p>Laming stragglers at the dark age or early feudal age can really hurt!! Particularly, players that rely&nbsp;on farms early on. Few concerned strategies are Drush + Fast Castle, Drush, Scout Rush. You can <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>prevent this laming</strong></span> from happening by <strong>having 3 villagers to chop a straggler.</strong> Only then It cannot be lamed.</p><p><strong>Step One:</strong> <a title="3 Effective Ways of Scouting in Age Of Empires 2" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/scout-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Explore your enemy</a></p><p>

</p><h2>8- Hill Advantage</h2><p>Obviously, many of you are aware of the hill advantage in Age of Empires 2. Aren&rsquo;t you? Historically, The military importance of hill advantage has been known for more than 2000 years.</p><p>For example in Sun Tzu&rsquo;s The Art of War, in which armed service leaders were advised to take the high ground and let the enemy make an effort to hit from a lower position. As a result, an army downhill can be quickly harmed due gravity and other factors.</p><p>
<div id="attachment_431" style="width: 738px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-431" class="size-full wp-image-431" src="" alt="A scout taking a fight uphill in age of empire 2" width="728" height="461" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hill-advantage-age-of-empire-2.jpg 728w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hill-advantage-age-of-empire-2-505x320.jpg 505w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hill-advantage-age-of-empire-2.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-431" class="wp-caption-text">A scout taking a fight uphill in age of empire 2</p></div>
</p><p>In Age of Empires 2, a unit fighting uphill has <span style="color: #ff0000;">25% attack</span> bonus and <span style="color: #ff0000;">25% armor</span> bonus. Ergo, fighting on a high ground is technically getting an extra attack and armor upgrades.</p><p>
