<p><img decoding="async" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alaric-scenario-minimap.png" alt="Alaric AoE2 DE" width="256px" /></p>
<p>Alaric I (370/375 ‚Äì 410 A.D.) was the first king of the Visigoths from 395 to his death. He is most famous for sacking Rome in 410, an event considered to have contributed decisively to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and the beginning of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Attila</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Attila-scenario-minimap.png" alt="Attila AoE2 DE" width="256px" /></p>
<p>Attila the Hun (395?/406? &#8211; March 453 A.D) was the King of the Huns from 434 to his death. His rule is depicted in a campaign in Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. Attila is a cavalry hero found only in the The Scourge of God and The Fall of Rome scenarios of his campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Bukhara</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bukhara-scenario-minimap.png" alt="Bukhara AoE2 DE" width="256px" /></p>

<p><strong>Dos</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dos-scenario-minimap.png" alt="Dos AoE2 DE" width="256px" /></p>

<h2 align="left">Transitions</h2>
<p align="left">Given the dark age economy of this build, any transition is viable. In this section, I will help you tweak your economy to smoothen your transition to any unit combo you desire.</p>
<h3 align="left">Full Scouts</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1269 size-full" title="Full Scouts Transition" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Scouts-Transition.jpg" alt="Full Scouts Transition" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Scouts-Transition.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Scouts-Transition-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">By default in our build we click up to feudal age with 5 or 6 farmers, but assuming you would like to transition into a full scouts build. You will need at least 9, 10 or 11 farmers before you reach Feudal Age meaning your lumberjacks should be only 8 (but no less than 8).</p>
<p align="left">So if you wish to have 10 or 11 farmers simply remove 1 or 2 foragers and assign them as farmers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At Feudal Age:</strong> Build 1 stable, upgrade wood and food. (Start queuing scouts non-stop)</li>
<li><strong>At 175 wood:</strong> Build 2<sup>nd</sup> stable. (Keep spamming scouts)</li>
<li><strong>At 100 gold:</strong> Research <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/435.png" alt="Bloodlines upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Bloodlines</li>
<li><strong>At 14 ‚Äì 15 Farmers:</strong> Build a blacksmith</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Keep focusing on queuing nonstop scouts &amp; over farming. Spam Farms nonstop!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At 17 ‚Äì 19 mins:</strong> Research <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/213.png" alt="wheelbarrow upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Wheelbarrow</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You have the freedom to stay longer in feudal age and spam scouts all day long. Or try to go up to Castle age if you feel like you can‚Äôt do much damage.</p>
<h3 align="left">Full Feudal</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1270 size-full" title="Full Feudal Transition" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Feudal-Transition.jpg" alt="Full Feudal Transition" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Feudal-Transition.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Feudal-Transition-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></p>
<p align="left">This build has great synergy with a full Feudal age transition. In fact the build remains intact until 13 mins..</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At 13:30 mins:</strong> Build 1<sup>st</sup> stable.</li>
<li><strong>At 14:30 mins:</strong> Build 2<sup>nd</sup> Archery Range.</li>
<li><strong>At 16:00 mins:</strong> Build 2<sup>nd</sup> Stable.</li>
<li><strong>At 17 ‚Äì 19 mins:</strong> Research<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/213.png" alt="wheelbarrow upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Wheelbarrow</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">The aim of Full feudal is to keep spamming: Archers, Skirmishers, Scouts, Spearmen. Then raid your opponent and take as many engages as possible, considering that your units have all or most of these upgrades:</p>
<figure id="attachment_1263" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1263" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/full-feudal-upgrades-to-research.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1263 size-full" title="full feudal upgrades to research" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/full-feudal-upgrades-to-research.jpg" alt="full feudal upgrades to research" width="300" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1263" class="wp-caption-text">Full Feudal Military Upgrades to Research</figcaption></figure>
<p align="left">Full feudal wars usually hit 28 ‚Äì 30 mins before clicking up to Castle Age. So be prepared for a long war and spam military units non-stop. Don&#8217;t give up!</p>
<h3 align="left">Tower Rush (Trush)</h3>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tower-Rush-Transition.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1268 size-full" title="Tower Rush Transition" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tower-Rush-Transition.jpg" alt="Tower Rush Transition" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tower-Rush-Transition.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tower-Rush-Transition-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">Hmm, hmm! When you spot your opponent walling like a maniac before 10 mins. Your reaction is to build a mine camp with 3 villagers near any accessible stone piles exactly by the time you click up to feudal age which is 10 mins. You will have only 9 Lumberjacks instead of 12.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At 40% Feudal Age:</strong> Pull 4 foragers and send them forward.</li>
<li><strong>At Feudal Age Researched:</strong> Build one lonely stable at Home. Build a Tower with your forward villagers behind any crucial resource.</li>
<li><strong>At 150 wood available:</strong> Build a blacksmith (Research <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/199.png" alt="Fletching" width="48" height="48" />Fletching to increase tower range and damage.)</li>
<li><strong>At 150 Food 100 Gold available:</strong> Research <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/435.png" alt="Bloodlines upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Bloodlines in the stable.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">The plan is pretty simple, spam towers, scouts and a few spears in an attempt to burst through the walls into his base. Just don‚Äôt give up!</p>

<h2 align="left">How To Counter Other Strategies?</h2>
<h3 align="left">Counter a Scout Rush</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1266" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/full-scouts-raiding-party.jpg" alt="counter a full scout rush build" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://ageofnotes.com/strategies/scout-rush-build-order-secrets-step-step/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scout rushes</a> are not all the same. Some like to click up with 20 pop around (7:20 mins), or 21 pop (7:36 mins), or 22 pop (8:03 mins) or even 23 pop (8:23 mins). I would only worry about 20 and 21 pop because these benchmarks let your opponent hit feudal at 9:30 mins.</p>
<p align="left">Assuming your opponent went for a 20 or 21 pop. His stable will be built and ready to queue scouts at 10:05 mins. By 12:00 mins, he will have a total of 3 to 4 scouts. You should be fine if he decides to defend his base from your militias; but problematic if he heads to your base straight forward.</p>
<p align="left">So the first question is‚Ä¶</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Which Civilizations usually go for a 20 or 21 pop ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mongols</li>
<li>Persians</li>
<li>Huns</li>
<li>Franks</li>
<li>Indians</li>
<li>Khmer</li>
<li>Slavs</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><strong>How to defend your base against 3-4 scouts at 12 mins?</strong></p>
<p align="left">The only con of this build is the fact that we hit Feudal age around 12 mins. Basically within the timespan of 12 to 13 mins, we are more or less vulnerable. To overcome this vulnerability we have two options:</p>
<blockquote><p>Keep harassing your opponent with the 5 militias until 11:00 mins then retreat to defend at home. (queue 1 Spearman before upgrading to <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/men-at-arms-upgrade-e1614780237128.png" alt="" width="49" height="49" />men at arms)</p></blockquote>
<p>OR</p>
<blockquote><p>Create (3 &#8211; 4) new militias and keep them garrisoned inside the barracks until 12 mins. Now use them to defend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p align="left">There is always a third options but probably risky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Quick-Wall in your all exposed villagers around 11 ‚Äì 12 mins.</p>

<h3 align="left">Counter Drush &amp; Men at Arms</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1058" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/men-at-arms.jpg" alt="men at arms play" width="530" height="373" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/men-at-arms.jpg 530w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/men-at-arms-455x320.jpg 455w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></p>
<p align="left">5 Militias Drush is a counter-build to Drushes &amp; Men at arms. You can easily proceed with the build as it is. However playing defensive instead of aggressive in feudal age is likely more rewarding, especially against archer sneaks. Feel free to research Town Watch to increase the line of sight around your base.</p>
<p align="left">The kind of upgrades you never want to miss are:<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/199.png" alt="Fletching" width="48" height="48" />Fletching and <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/211.png" alt="Padded Armor upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Padded Archer Armor. The only situation when you can ignore the armor upgrade is when your opponent has barely any army.</p>
<p align="left">But bear in mind that if you scout your opponent laying down huge walls left and right. It‚Äôs no brainer that he‚Äôs intending to go Castle Age asap. Logically, you can react with instant aggression of towers and a spam of scout. Or simply be the king of monkeys and do the same thing.</p>
<h3 align="left">Counter Forward Rush</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1274" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Forward.jpg" alt="Counter Forward Rush" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Forward.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Forward-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></p>
<p align="left">Forwards are extremely rare since the release of AoE2 DE. And it‚Äôs safe to say that our 5 Militias build is not only a hard counter, but also an instant gg to your opponent if you catch his villagers off guard half way; hence the reason for I recommended previously to use the Barrack‚Äôs rally point near any forward enemy resource.</p>
<p align="left">The best way to deal with forwards is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spot the enemy villagers</li>
<li>Use both Militias and (4 or 5) of your own villagers to scare away or deny your opponent forward.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Skirmishers &amp; men at arms are the best combo to deal with a forward in the early phase. Later on you can switch to archers or scouts depending on feels like the right call.</p>
<h3 align="left">Counter Archers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1273" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Archers.jpg" alt="Counter Archers" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Archers.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Archers-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></p>
<p align="left">Countering pure archer builds, such 22 or 23 pop double archery range, comes down to how good you did with your 5 militias starting from <strong>09:00 mins</strong> onwards. Denying his gold miners should your priority number 1, wood lines come as a second priority then the foragers.</p>
<p align="left">Often you want to take what you can get, be it foragers, gold miners, deer hunters or lumberjacks. And that is totally fine as long as you‚Äôll switch your raiding focus later on to only harassing gold miners and lumberjacks.</p>
<p align="left">At Feudal age, build 1 archery range and a blacksmith then fully commit to skirmishers. In fact as soon as you research fletching you can pull your gold miners from gold then assign them as farmers. You want to ‚Äúfarm hard and skirm hard‚Äù. Do not even bother with archers unless he goes for a stable or you wish to transition to Crossbows. Either way going for a stable yourself isn‚Äôt a bad idea at all.</p>

<h2 align="left">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This build order synergizes better with 3 Civilizations: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="‚úÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Huns, <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="‚úÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Persians, &amp; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="‚úÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Britons. But keep in mind that <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26d4.png" alt="‚õî" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Bulgarians &amp; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26d4.png" alt="‚õî" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Spanish lack Crossbowman upgrade, so if you ever pick them &#8211; Think anything but archers. Apart from these two exceptions, it&#8217;s safe to say the build order works well with the rest of the civilizations.</p>
<p>Be a nice to your opponent and have fun <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2>1.Use Hotkeys</h2>
<p>If you want to get better at this game, hotkeys are the primary priority to consider. What are hotkeys? It is basically using your keyboard to build and play the game (not just the mouse). You can access and edit your hotkeys by running the game, click the gear button top right hand side</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1155" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/options-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive.jpg" alt="options for age of empires 2 definitive - aoe 2 tips" width="422" height="259" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/options-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive.jpg 630w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/options-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-521x320.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>
<p>Then click Option and Hotkeys. From there you can view what each hotkey does and why not edit some of them to suit you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1154 size-large" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021-1024x706.jpg" alt="hotkeys tips for age of empires 2 DE" width="1024" height="706" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021-1024x706.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021-464x320.jpg 464w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021-768x530.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><br />
After checking out and editing your hotkeys, you should now start practicing them in &#8220;Editors&#8221;, create a new scenario and generate a random map and set all resources to 9999.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1156" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/map-editor-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition.jpg" alt="age of empires 2 definitive edition map editor" width="474" height="264" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/map-editor-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition.jpg 941w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/map-editor-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-574x320.jpg 574w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/map-editor-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></p>
<p>Then build economical/military structures one by one until you memorize them, It should take you a few minutes or less depending if you are a fast learner.</p>
<h2>Practice One Easy Build Order</h2>
<p>&#8220;The most complicated skill is to be simple.&#8221; &#8211; Learning intermediate or advanced build orders will certainly hinder your learning. it&#8217;s like a 7 year old asking to skip school and high school straight up to college. If you want to get better at any RTS game and faster.. You ought to start step by step and learn the easiest build chunk by chunk.</p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/archers.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1170" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/archers.jpg" alt="23 archers build order blueprint" width="359" height="636" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/archers.jpg 480w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/archers-181x320.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></a></p>
<p>Strategy tips wise, easy build orders such as <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/strategies/23-pop-archers-build-order-step-by-step-to-destroy-ranked-queue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 Archers</a> or the <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/build-orders/fast-castle-build-order-knights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fast Castle Knight Rush</a> should teach you the basics of running a good economy. The funny part is that the <span style="color: #008000;">dark age economy is 99% similar to any intermediate or advanced build</span>. So rest assured an easy build order will pave road for any build order out there. But most importantly force you to focus on your economy and that&#8217;s the whole point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep practicing the same build order over and over (losing or winning doesn&#8217;t matter) &#8211; What matters is tracking and improving your feudal/castle age times. Yes! It may be boring at first but later&#8230; Trust me the outcome is yourself better than most players in your league.</p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Huns, Britons &amp; Persians are beginner friendly civilizations and best for practice.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px">
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Huns do not need houses saving lots of wood for military production and farms. Besides never getting pop capped.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Britons consume sheep faster leaving your town center in constant villager production. It&#8217;s the best civ for 23 archers build order since archers are trained 20% faster.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Persians set off with extra resources allowing constant villager production and a better dark age economy. Also access to almost the entirety of tech tree.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</div></div>
<p>It&#8217;s up to you now &#8211; Do you want to master AoE2 the fast and right way or just try out random builds and slowly improve?</p>
<h3>Follow-up yourself and ensure mastering the build order</h3>
<p>First and foremost how do you know you really learnt that easy build order? Each build order has markers or timestamps that confirm whether you mastered the build order or not. Here is a list of tips (markers) to check against your build orders:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking Feudal Age with <strong>22 population at 8:07</strong> (Max benchmark). Or 23 population at 8:35 mins (Max benchmark).</li>
<li>Have you researched economic upgrades as soon as you hit Feudal age?</li>
<li>Do you have <strong>12 to 14 farms before 15 mins</strong> (depending on build order)?</li>
<li>Have you researched <strong>wheelbarrow at 16 mins</strong> to go up Castle faster. Or <strong>18 mins to go up late</strong> with an economic advantage. Or <strong>no wheelbarrow</strong> with a vulnerable economy?</li>
<li>Have you clicked <strong>Castle Age at 22 mins (max) or earlier</strong>?</li>
</ol>
<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>You are ready to practice and learn intermediate and advance builders. Only this time you will find them more practical and easier than before.</p>
<p>I recommend Two Build orders:</p>

<h2>Use Visual Mods</h2>
<p>Visual mods might seem like stupid AoE 2 tips to you or beginner players &#8211; But the fact is a visual mod improves the gameplay experience in multiplayer and have a positive impact on your gameplay.<br />
Let‚Äôs a take a look at these extremely useful and must have mods:</p>
<h3>A) Small Trees</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1171 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/small-tree-ageofempires2.gif" alt="Small trees for Age of empires 2 Definitive" width="402" height="302" /></p>
<p>This mod reduces the height of trees as a result you get a clear view of your lumberjacks and easily micro them for a better wood saturation</p>
<p><strong>Why shouldn‚Äôt you use the original big trees?</strong></p>
<p>The Original Trees makes it difficult for players to select and micro their lumberjacks behind those big trees. It is also frustrating to wall across forest patches as you might miss a tile or two.</p>

<h3>B) Advanced Idle Pointer</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1173" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-1024x641.png" alt="advanced idle pointer for age of empires 2 definitive edition" width="620" height="388" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-1024x641.png 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-511x320.png 511w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-768x481.png 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition.png 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Beginner players tend to idle their villagers a lot. It is also the case of average/expert players and that does not mean they are inattentive player. It‚Äôs just that sometimes you would be staring at your idles but not notice them because your attention is directed somewhere else.</p>
<p>Hence the idea of this mod is to display an exclamation mark over any idle villager to alert you therefore less idle time and higher chances to win more games than before.</p>

<h3>C) Huge Number</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1174" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number-1024x641.jpg" alt="Huge Number for age of empires 2 definitive edition" width="620" height="388" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number-511x320.jpg 511w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number-768x481.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number.jpg 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Huge Number increases the size of control group numbers making them easily visible. So you don‚Äôt want to be that guy that boxes his units every game and all day long then eventually his hand ends up unnecessarily exhausted. Notably, the higher your game resolution the smaller the control group numbers so players with glasses or without glasses would squinch their eyes to see those numbers.</p>

<h2>Watch Recorded Games Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1157" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive-1024x661.jpg" alt="watch replays in age of empires 2 definitive" width="620" height="400" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive-1024x661.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive-495x320.jpg 495w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive-768x496.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes of watching recorded games is not taking down the hidden tips and tricks of a build or grasp the reasoning behind a specific transition or unit choice. Sometimes you see a pro do Drush Fast castle but what you do not comprehend is why, when or what?</p>
<p>Throughout my journey of watching hundreds of recorded games I devised a 3-steps-method</p>
<h3>Step 1: Answer WH questions</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m sure most of you are familiar with WH questions. We studied those at school and here we are again employing them in a video game &#8211; Ironic!? I will jump straight to an example and answer these WH questions along the way to give you an idea how to process information from a replay.</p>
<ol>
<li>What map is it? e.g. Arabia</li>
<li>What civilizations are they playing? e.g. Britons Vs Teutons</li>
<li>How is their Maps, Open or Closed? e.g. Britons (Closed Map) Vs Teutons (Open map)</li>
<li>Where the Britons Resource located at? e.g. Main gold is in the back</li>
<li>What‚Äôs the Britons Population after clicking Feudal Age?</li>
</ol>
<p>(Feel free to ask more WH questions to deeply analyze any playstyle or opening. However these should be enough)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 2: Extract The Build Order Timeline</h3>
<p>The best way to learn a build order is to take down every little detail to mimic the build order to perfection.<br />
A great and concise way of doing so is to take note of time as well as the task. Sometimes you can use population or any event as a timeline marker.</p>
<p>Take this Drush build as an example: [@ means (at)]
@6:04: Build barracks<br />
@7:05: Start creating Militias<br />
@9:20 ‚Äì 9:30: Hit enemy base with Militias<br />
@32 Pop: Click Feudal Age (Scout + 3 Militias counted in)<br />
@Clicked Feudal Age Button: Finish walling<br />
@Feudal Age: Build Archery range &amp; Blacksmith</p>
<p>@14:00: 12 built farms.<br />
@15:00: Research Fletching<br />
etc.</p>
<p>(Feel free to use the same structure or invent your own way whatever helps you memorize faster. If you are new to the game you may want to add more items such as how many farmers, gold miners, and lumberjacks.)</p>
<p>See how clean and intuitive? I hope you understand this trick, didn&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s all about things that take place in specific times. Keep track of those and your execution will be as perfect as you never imagined.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Conclusion &amp; Practice Time</h3>
<p>This is the most crucial tip to fully grasp the build!! From Step 1 &amp; 2 you must come to a conclusion that the Britons player went for Drush Fast castle because his main gold was in the back and his map was easy to wall.</p>
<p><strong>So should I execute Drush FC in any map generation?</strong> No, you may not (possible in an open map but risky).</p>
<p><strong>What do you learn?</strong> Do NOT come to a conclusion by yourself. Let Step 1 WH questions conclude for you.</p>
<p>Now it‚Äôs about time to practice and practice makes perfect. No practice No progress! It does not have to be a ranked game, just a few casual practice games against the AI would do the trick.</p>
<p>What happens if you do not practice? In 1 or 3 weeks you‚Äôll forget everything or a few things from what you watched.</p>

<h2>Play To Learn/Improve Your Game-Play (Not to improve your ELO)</h2>
<p>‚ÄúI will play ranked to improve my ELO.‚Äù ‚Äì Stop thinking like that!! You will fall in the procrastinating trap as soon as you start losing a few games. Your brain will spread negative thoughts due to losing ELO. Keep your mentality detoxified from negativity to perform better.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on improving your ELO, find your points of weaknesses or mistakes committed in previous games then concentrate 90% of your energy to fix those. At the end of the day even if you lose; your mentality remains intact for you have taken time to fix your gameplay issues.</p>
<h2>Small Goals Trick (To Fight Ladder Anxiety &amp; Be Efficient)</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1152 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ladder-anxiety-explained.fw_.png" alt="Fight Ladder Anxiety aoe 2 tips and trick" width="408" height="325" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ladder-anxiety-explained.fw_.png 408w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ladder-anxiety-explained.fw_-402x320.png 402w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">Do you feel nervous, shaky or your heart beats faster when jumping in a ranked game or playing against a pro?</span><br />
Do 5, 10 or 20 push-ups to get rid of the shakiness.</p>
<p>It is totally normal for a human being to have feelings of excitement. That only says how much of an emotional human being you are; love and care about the game and its outcome.</p>
<p>Nonetheless.. You must overcome those feeling before the game begins so you can concentrate on the game income not the outcome.</p>
<p>Today, I will share with you the small goals tips to conquer your inner-fear.</p>
<p><strong>First Step..</strong></p>
<p>Rehearse some of these phrases at the start of the game:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a game I don&#8217;t care&#8221;,<br />
&#8220;My enemy is probably shitting his pants more than I do&#8221;,<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s a practice game I don&#8217;t care about end results&#8221;,<br />
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about ELO I want to improve this and that&#8221;.</p>
<p>Your brain cares a lot about the game and take it very seriously. Therefore that brain of yours visualizes and prioritizes the vision of unresolved small negative scenarios rather than fun and small positive scenarios notably due to emotion.</p>
<p>So how can you reverse the order of visions in your brain from small negatives-positive (&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;+) to small positives+negative (+++++++++-)?<br />
Second Step..</p>
<p>You simply need to put small goals in your brain before/during the beginning of the game. Small goals are the small mistakes you did in the previous games. And in the next game try to fix them one after another.</p>
<p><strong>This example will illustrate step 1 &amp; 2:</strong></p>
<p>In the previous game (Mistakes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Your TC had some idle time</li>
<li>You lured the second boar late</li>
<li>You didn‚Äôt find all 8 sheep</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next game (Fix Mistakes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your TC is making villagers</li>
<li>Lure the second boar earlier</li>
<li>Find all your 8 sheep</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixing those small goals (mistakes) ==&gt; For every and any small mistake you fix you are building up a positive momentum in your brain which boosts and inflates positive signs over negative signs. End results: Your brain visualizes Positives over negatives (+++++++++++-) &lt;== positives is ruling over negatives and self-confidence is boosted.</p>

<h2>Play Other (RTS) Games</h2>

<p>Sometimes you start losing focus or throw games easily so that&#8217;s usually a sign of boredom or exhaustion. It would be best stop grinding age of empires all day¬† and take a break. Play other RTS games for a change.</p>
<p>Games that <strong>truly</strong> resemble Age of empires 2 &amp; I personally enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><a href="https://starcraft2.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starcraft 2</a> (5 Stars)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I promise you that you will experience new mechanics and ironically get better at Age of empires 2. These games are not only fun and extremely similar to AoE2 but also will increase your reaction time and attention to little details.</p>
<p>From my personal experience, and back in Voobly days I used to be 14+ but then after taking a break I started playing SC2, EE2 and Caesar3 then a month later I was the first among my friends to make it to 16+ then later 18+.</p>
<h2>Stay Hydrated &amp; Foods</h2>
<h3>Water: Does Dehydration impact your gaming performance?</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1176" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/brain-is-75-percent-water.jpg" alt="brain is 75 percent water" width="467" height="311" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/brain-is-75-percent-water.jpg 900w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/brain-is-75-percent-water-480x320.jpg 480w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/brain-is-75-percent-water-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>Did you know your brain is about 75% water?[1] And when It‚Äôs functioning on a full reserve of water you will¬† be more focused, think faster and experience greater clarity and creativity, additionally the removal of toxins from your brain and supplying essential nutrients work at higher rate.<br />
A fully hydrated brain exchanges nutrients and toxins faster ensuring better concentration and mental awareness.</p>
<p><strong>How much should you drink?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1187" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sipping-water-while-gaming.jpg" alt="sipping water while gaming" width="438" height="271" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sipping-water-while-gaming.jpg 640w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sipping-water-while-gaming-517x320.jpg 517w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /></p>
<p>There is no way to know how much an individual should drink, but having a bottle nearby to take sips of fresh water constantly is the smartest thing to do.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Nutrients in food are not only essential to survival and health but also a metric to excel in your daily activities. Both physical and mental activities are involved when you are gaming. These types of foods are recommended to boost gaming activity:</p>
<p><strong>Omega-3 Rich Foods</strong> (Mental Boosters)</p>

<li>Any Omega-3 Rich Fish</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Have Fun</h2>
<p>I can not emphasize enough the criticality of Fun. Games are supposed to entertain you. So If you take age of empires too seriously you will enter the circle of procrastination. Where you start visualizing yourself winning a game beforehand. And failing to do so may trigger particular behaviors such as anger or boredom. Such behaviors will have a profound impact in your next games.</p>
<p><strong>Age of empires 2 tips and tricks to Have Fun ?</strong></p>
<p>Create some excitements in your life before you play age of empires online. So what cheers you up the most? For me ordering electronics or going out with friends lightens up my mood. Now suddenly winning a game in AoE2 is less important than receiving my order or meeting friends.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to play AoE2 and focus at improving something in your gameplay. I talked about this previously in Tip#6: Small Goals Trick that way even if you lose, your main goal was to improve this and that not win the game. And Remember that losing is an opportunity to improve nobody on planet earth is born with a winning syndrome.</p>
<p>Here is a replay proof from <strong><span style="color: #800000;">TheViper back in the days when he was a noob</span></strong> just to prove a point.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s silly of me to generate such a stupid graph but it&#8217;s always nice to remind your brain how huge is 70%</p>
<p>As usually the guide will be tackled in the very little details. <strong>There is also a video version of this guide..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAFOb-cY9YA?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" title=""></iframe></div>
<h2>Hotkeys Setup</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to the hotkey world, It&#8217;s recommended to use one of the hotkey presets of pro players. For that reason I got you covered with a pack of hotkey files which you can either install them yourself manually or use a little app to accomplish it in glimpse of an eye.</p>
<h3><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Manual Method</span></h3>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">1. Download the hotkey files zip: <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hotkey-Profiles.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotkey-Profiles.zip</a></span></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">2. Press <kbd>Windows Button</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd></span></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">3. Type in: <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>%userprofile%\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">4. A folder should pop up. Now inside it you&#8217;ll find another folder or more with random numbers e.g. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aoe2de-hotkeys-profiles-location.png" alt="aoe2de hotkeys profiles example" width="372" height="206" /></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">5. Enter those folders with the random numbers then inside &#8220;/profile/&#8221; folder extract the hotkey files zip inside them both &#8220;76561198079200175&#8221; &amp; &#8220;76561198286982586&#8221;, but if you only have one folder it&#8217;s ok. It should look like this</span></p>

<h3>Automatic Method</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re feeling lazy to manually install the hotkey pack, you can download this little tool from here:</p>

<h2>Units &amp; Objects</h2>
<p>in Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition or any previous version, we can set hotkeys to <span style="color: #339966;">4 sets of units &amp; objects</span>:</p>
<p><strong>1- Military Units</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1089 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits.jpg" alt="military units assign hotkeys" width="347" height="200" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits.jpg 703w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits-555x320.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2- Buildings</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1090 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-1024x495.jpg" alt="buildings hotkey bindings" width="351" height="170" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-1024x495.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-622x301.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-768x371.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings.jpg 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3- Workers</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1091 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2.jpg" alt="" width="352" height="168" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2.jpg 818w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2-622x297.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2-768x367.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4- Animals</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1092 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals.jpg" alt="animals hotkey binding" width="346" height="209" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals.jpg 536w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals-531x320.jpg 531w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">How To Set a Hotkey on Unit(s) Object(s)?</span></h3>
<p>Use your mouse to box whatever object(s) or unit(s) you wish to hotkey then for example: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd> 1 </kbd>(select any number from 0 &#8211; 9)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1093" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1.jpg" alt="hotkeying units with ctrl + 1" width="426" height="301" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1.jpg 598w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1-452x320.jpg 452w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p>Now that our army above is set to number 1. There are two ways to employ this hotkey.</p>
<h4>Single Click On Keyboard Key¬†<kbd> 1 </kbd></h4>
<p>Only selects your units without switching camera view.</p>
<h4>Double Click on Keyboard Key¬†<kbd> 1</kbd></h4>
<p>Selects your units and switches the camera view at their location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> When taking fights away from town, you can use single click (number 4 for example) to select the town center and queue villagers without having to switch the camera view. Or pull your army away using the single click.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Camera &amp; Location Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Although Age of Empires 2 do not have dedicated camera hotkeys as those in Starcraft 2&#8230; Fortunately for us we do have cycle commands that essentially work like the camera hotkeys for example</p>
<figure id="attachment_1094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1094" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1094" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys.jpg" alt="camera hotkeys for age of empires 2 definitive" width="635" height="410" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys.jpg 939w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys-496x320.jpg 496w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1094" class="wp-caption-text">Cycle Commands work like camera hotkeys.</figcaption></figure>
<p>As long as you build a lumbercamp, mill, mining camp, or barracks. You can use go to hotkeys to switch to view to those structures.</p>
<p>Switch camera to:</p>
<p>Lumberjacks =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> (Replicate hotkey to switch to another lumbercamp location)</p>
<p>Foragers/Farmers =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> (Replicate hotkey to switch to another mill location)</p>
<p>Gold/Stone Miners =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> (Replicate hotkeys to switch to another mining camp location)</p>
<p>ETC. (Same thing applies to barracks, archery range, university, castles, etc.)</p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Abuse location hotkeys instead of moving your mouse around to save time and unnecessary moves. And keep your hand muscles more energized for important micro tasks.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tips For Queuing Units Faster</h2>
<h3>Shift Hotkeys</h3>
<p>Shift hotkeys are a brand-new and exclusive mechanic for the definitive edition of Age of Empires 2. A basic usage of shift hotkeying is to assign any unit to a sequential of actions or tasks.</p>
<p>For example if you can command a villager to do 4 actions by himself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a house.</li>
<li>Consume a Forage Bush.</li>
<li>Gather Fish</li>
<li>Mine gold</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-1" width="480" height="268" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4</a></video></div>
<ol>
<li>Select a Villager.</li>
<li>Build a house Then Hold <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key</li>
<li>Mouse Right Click on : a forage bush, fish patch, and finally gold patch.</li>
<li>Take your finger off <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key</li>
</ol>
<h3>Queuing Units Faster</h3>
<p>Queuing military units with hotkeys makes a colossal difference in the battle and between two beginner players.¬† Today I will teach two methods to queue your army then choose whatever you goes with your taste.</p>
<p>You must first configure Select All hotkeys to suit your needs by entering Options &gt; Hotkeys &gt; Game Commands. Then scroll down to find them</p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1099" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-1024x626.jpg" alt="select all hotkeys for age of empires 2 definitive edition" width="492" height="301" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-523x320.jpg 523w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-768x470.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys.jpg 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></a></p>
<h4>Method 1: Select All Military Buildings of Specific type</h4>
<p>As the title suggests, we will use &#8220;Game Commands&#8221;¬† to only select specific or all military buildings (without switching camera view). Eventually we&#8217;ll end up pressing two or 3 button:</p>
<ul>
<li>First button (for example) selects all archery ranges available (e.g. <kbd>D</kbd> =&gt; Archery Range(s)).</li>
<li>Second button queues a specific unit (e.g. <kbd>G</kbd> =&gt; Archer)</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-2" width="480" height="422" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>You can configure a hotkey to &#8220;select all&#8221; Stable, Town Centers, Siege workshop, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Method 2: Filtering Military Buildings</h4>
<p>This method has a decent potential if you have different types of military buildings and wish to filter through them. How to proceed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <kbd>5</kbd> to select all military buildings or configure it to something.</li>
<li>Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and mouse left click on any military building icon to select only that specific type of building.</li>
<li>Queue army.</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-3" width="480" height="388" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4</a></video></div>
<h2>Hotkeying Techs &amp; Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Unlike the previous versions of Age of empires 2.. AoE2 DE lets you assign hotkeys to any building that offer technologies or upgrades to research.</p>
<p>By the default no hotkeys are assigned to upgrades and techs so to configure them go to Options &gt; Hotkeys ; Then to your left hand side you should click a town center, lumbercamp, etc. to assign any hotkeys to the technologies/upgrades</p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1100" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-1024x617.jpg" alt="hotkeying technologies upgrades" width="597" height="360" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-531x320.jpg 531w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-768x463.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades.jpg 1443w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></a></p>
<h2>Typing Practice</h2>
<p>it is crucial in any RTS game to have a decent typing speed to manage hotkeys and multi-task faster and while some of you may think they are fast typers ..</p>
 <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- Horizontal_1_AoN -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"

     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p>Trust me there is one way to find out <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastfingers.com</a> .Usually a fast typer has an average of <strong>60 WPM</strong> (words per minute), less than that you my friend are not a fast typer yet. Check out the video i posted at the beginning of this guide (skip to 8:57) where I took the typing test.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For beginners, practicing hotkeys in the editor mode is certainly the fastest and best way to memorize them. Don&#8217;t be afraid of wasting time because the reward is worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Do I need to do port forwarding?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-905 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/port-forwarding.png" alt="Port forwarding" width="463" height="266" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/port-forwarding.png 838w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/port-forwarding-556x320.png 556w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/port-forwarding-768x442.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" /></p>
<p>No! Port forwarding is not needed <strong>99,98%</strong> of the cases because a client server model relies mainly on TCP protocol to receive your commands and actions then the server returns a response to each player. By default TCP is always operational protocol even in Mobile broadband connections unlike UDP protocol.</p>
<p>The only case when you have to port forward is when your router is intentionally set to block any random TCP traffic through the firewall; or your Antivirus/firewall is blocking the server ip or traffic to that ip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can I play Age of Empires 2 DE with Mobile internet, would I lag?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-906 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming-461x320.jpg" alt="Play AoE 2 DE with mobile broadband connection" width="461" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming-461x320.jpg 461w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p>Yes! You can play using Mobile internet unless (your internet provider blocks gaming activities) but that&#8217;s extremely rare. Lag is measured based on your internet speed and ping.</p>
<p>A minimum requirement is 2 MB download, 0.3 Upload and a low Ping which is also crucial to communicate with multiplayer servers.¬† Because It determines how much delay you are getting in the course of the game-play. However the game is less likely to stuffer as in peer-to-peer.</p>
<h2>What if one or more than one player are lagging, would they affect the rest of the players?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-918 size-medium" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png" alt="multiplayer reasons to lose" width="368" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png 368w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></p>
<p>No! Whoever lags will lag himself not others. 3G internet speed of at least 2 MB download, 0.3 upload and a decent ping is the bare minimum for an average to good multiplayer experience.</p>
<h2>What if my internet drops for less than 60 seconds, would I get back to the game?</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes! One of the outstanding advantages of this brand-new multiplayer is the ability to get back into the game if you have dropped for less 60 seconds, therefore, other players won&#8217;t have to save and exit then restore again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What if the servers are down, Can we play multiplayer?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-909 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg" alt="servers are down thus multiplayer" width="430" height="228" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg 603w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-768x407.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-300x160.jpg 300w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down.jpg 950w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></p>
<p>No! When the servers are down you have to wait until they are back on to play multiplayer, however you can still play single player or watch recorded games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In a multiplayer game, My game crashed and shut down, Can I run it again and get back to game?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-910 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png" alt="game crashing unexpectedly" width="495" height="171" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /></p>
<p>Yes! When your game shuts down while playing multiplayer, you should be able to get back to the game but you have to join in less than 60 seconds or whatever the timeout is set to. Also It depends if this feature is implemented or not however it is entirely possible to add.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Would players in a far region struggle with other regions?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-912 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/regions-and-pings-1.png" alt="regions and pings" width="452" height="532" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia, and Asia may get 500 &#8211; 200 ping with Europe+North Africa/America regions. It always has been like that but at least the pings have the potential to be way better than the peer-to-peer version. I expect server coverage for every region so low pings are guaranteed, except the south African region which has been challenging for them to get any multiplayer coverage in the last years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Would there be live profile stats for players on the internet?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-913 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png" alt="live game stats for aoe 2 de" width="479" height="448" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png 479w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287-342x320.png 342w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></p>
<p>Yes, It&#8217;s entirely possible to have your profile stats saved on your xbox profile, but the question is, have they planned it yet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Would players be able to fake their ELO?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-915 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg" alt="cheating in age of empires 2" width="620" height="395" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-502x320.jpg 502w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-768x490.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193.jpg 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>No! It&#8217;s almost impossible. The only way to fake ELO is to deliberately cheat to earn ELO, and that should be more challenging than before. With the a presence of a good anticheat, people reporting and the live game stats; cheaters would be caught like rats in a trap.</p>

<h2>Irrelevant to multiplayer, but do I need a bigger monitor to see the game zoomed out?</h2>

<p>No, You don&#8217;t! Any laptop or screen profits from x4 zoom.</p>
