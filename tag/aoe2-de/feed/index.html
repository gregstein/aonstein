										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This guide will teach you everything about hotkeys to take your gameplay to the next level. Wanna know a big secret? Hotkeys take a big chunk of a player&rsquo;s skill.. Check out the graph below<div id="attachment_1104" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1104" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1104 size-large" src="" alt="70% of your skill is hotkeys and speed" width="620" height="414" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills-480x320.jpeg 480w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills-1024x683.jpeg"><p id="caption-attachment-1104" class="wp-caption-text">70% of your skill is hotkeys and speed</p></div><p>It&rsquo;s silly of me to generate such a stupid graph but it&rsquo;s always nice to remind your brain how huge is 70%</p><p>As usually the guide will be tackled in the very little details. <strong>There is also a video version of this guide..</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAFOb-cY9YA?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" title=""></iframe></div><h2>Hotkeys Setup</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re new to the hotkey world, It&rsquo;s recommended to use one of the hotkey presets of pro players. For that reason I got you covered with a pack of hotkey files which you can either install them yourself manually or use a little app to accomplish it in glimpse of an eye.</p><h3><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Manual Method</span></h3><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">1. Download the hotkey files zip: <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hotkey-Profiles.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotkey-Profiles.zip</a></span></p><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">2. Press <kbd>Windows Button</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd></span></p><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">3. Type in: <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>%userprofile%\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE</strong></span></span></p><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">4. A folder should pop up. Now inside it you&rsquo;ll find another folder or more with random numbers e.g. </span></p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084" src="" alt="aoe2de hotkeys profiles example" width="372" height="206" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aoe2de-hotkeys-profiles-location.png"></p><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">5. Enter those folders with the random numbers then inside &ldquo;/profile/&rdquo; folder extract the hotkey files zip inside them both &ldquo;76561198079200175&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;76561198286982586&rdquo;, but if you only have one folder it&rsquo;s ok. It should look like this</span></p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1085" src="" alt="aoe2 hki files" width="372" height="244" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aoe2-hotkeys-hki-files.png"></p><h3>Automatic Method</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re feeling lazy to manually install the hotkey pack, you can download this little tool from here:</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HotkeyPack-DE.zip">HotkeyPack DE Tool To Install Pro Hotkeys</a></p><p>Inside the Archive there a &ldquo;<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>HotkeyPack-DE.exe</strong></span>&rdquo; file, just double click it ( no need to extract it) Then a window like this one appears:</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1087" src="" alt="" width="393" height="257" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hotkeypack-de-tool.jpg 689w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hotkeypack-de-tool-489x320.jpg 489w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hotkeypack-de-tool.jpg"></p><p>Press the install button and that&rsquo;s it. We have all these hotkey presets installed automatically.</p><h2>Units &amp; Objects</h2><p>in Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition or any previous version, we can set hotkeys to <span style="color: #339966;">4 sets of units &amp; objects</span>:</p><p><strong>1- Military Units</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1089 alignleft" src="" alt="military units assign hotkeys" width="347" height="200" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits.jpg 703w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits-555x320.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2- Buildings</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1090 alignleft" src="" alt="buildings hotkey bindings" width="351" height="170" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-1024x495.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-622x301.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-768x371.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings.jpg 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-1024x495.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3- Workers</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1091 alignleft" src="" alt="" width="352" height="168" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2.jpg 818w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2-622x297.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2-768x367.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4- Animals</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1092 alignleft" src="" alt="animals hotkey binding" width="346" height="209" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals.jpg 536w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals-531x320.jpg 531w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span style="color: #000000;">How To Set a Hotkey on Unit(s) Object(s)?</span></h3><p>Use your mouse to box whatever object(s) or unit(s) you wish to hotkey then for example: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd> 1 </kbd>(select any number from 0 &ndash; 9)</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1093" src="" alt="hotkeying units with ctrl + 1" width="426" height="301" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1.jpg 598w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1-452x320.jpg 452w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1.jpg"></p><p>Now that our army above is set to number 1. There are two ways to employ this hotkey.</p><h4>Single Mouse Click On <kbd> 1 </kbd></h4><p>Only selects your units without switching camera view.</p><h4>Double Mouse Click on <kbd> 1</kbd></h4><p>Selects your units and switches the camera view at their location.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> When taking fights away from town, you can use single mouse click (number 4 for example) to select the town center and queue villagers without having to switch the camera view. Or pull your army away using the single click.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Camera &amp; Location Hotkeys</h2><p>Although Age of Empires 2 do not have dedicated camera hotkeys as those in Starcraft 2&hellip; Fortunately for us we do have cycle commands that essentially work like the camera hotkeys for example</p><div id="attachment_1094" style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1094" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1094" src="" alt="camera hotkeys for age of empires 2 definitive" width="635" height="410" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys.jpg 939w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys-496x320.jpg 496w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-1094" class="wp-caption-text">Cycle Commands work like camera hotkeys.</p></div><p>As long as you build a lumbercamp, mill, mining camp, or barracks. You can use go to hotkeys to switch to view to those structures.</p><p>Switch camera to:</p><p>Lumberjacks =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> (Replicate hotkey to switch to another lumbercamp location)</p><p>Foragers/Farmers =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> (Replicate hotkey to switch to another mill location)</p><p>Gold/Stone Miners =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> (Replicate hotkeys to switch to another mining camp location)</p><p>ETC. (Same thing applies to barracks, archery range, university, castles, etc.)</p><div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Abuse location hotkeys instead of moving your mouse around to save time and unnecessary moves. And keep your hand muscles more energized for important micro tasks.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Tips For Queuing Units Faster</h2><h3>Shift Hotkeys</h3><p>Shift hotkeys are a brand-new and exclusive mechanic for the definitive edition of Age of Empires 2. A basic usage of shift hotkeying is to assign any unit to a sequential of actions or tasks.</p><p>For example if you can command a villager to do 4 actions by himself:</p><ol>
<li>Build a house.</li>
<li>Consume a Forage Bush.</li>
<li>Gather Fish</li>
<li>Mine gold</li>
</ol><p><strong>How?</strong></p><div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-1" width="480" height="268" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4?_=1"></source><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4</a></video></div><ol>
<li>Select a Villager.</li>
<li>Build a house Then Hold <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key</li>
<li>Mouse Right Click on : a forage bush, fish patch, and finally gold patch.</li>
<li>Take your finger off <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key</li>
</ol><h3>Queuing Units Faster</h3><p>Queuing military units with hotkeys makes a colossal difference in the battle and between two beginner players.&nbsp; Today I will teach two methods to queue your army then choose whatever you goes with your taste.</p><p>You must first configure Select All hotkeys to suit your needs by entering Options &gt; Hotkeys &gt; Game Commands. Then scroll down to find them</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1099" src="" alt="select all hotkeys for age of empires 2 definitive edition" width="492" height="301" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-523x320.jpg 523w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-768x470.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys.jpg 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-1024x626.jpg"></a></p><h4>Method 1: Select All Military Buildings of Specific type</h4><p>As the title suggests, we will use &ldquo;Game Commands&rdquo;&nbsp; to only select specific or all military buildings (without switching camera view). Eventually we&rsquo;ll end up pressing two or 3 button:</p><ul>
<li>First button (for example) selects all archery ranges available (e.g. <kbd>D</kbd> =&gt; Archery Range(s)).</li>
<li>Second button queues a specific unit (e.g. <kbd>G</kbd> =&gt; Archer)</li>
</ul><div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-2" width="480" height="422" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4?_=2"></source><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4</a></video></div><p>You can configure a hotkey to &ldquo;select all&rdquo; Stable, Town Centers, Siege workshop, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Method 2: Filtering Military Buildings</h4><p>This method has a decent potential if you have different types of military buildings and wish to filter through them. How to proceed?</p><ul>
<li>Press <kbd>5</kbd> to select all military buildings or configure it to something.</li>
<li>Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and mouse left click on any military building icon to select only that specific type of building.</li>
<li>Queue army.</li>
</ul><div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-3" width="480" height="388" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4?_=3"></source><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4</a></video></div><h2>Hotkeying Techs &amp; Hotkeys</h2><p>Unlike the previous versions of Age of empires 2.. AoE2 DE lets you assign hotkeys to any building that offer technologies or upgrades to research.</p><p>By the default no hotkeys are assigned to upgrades and techs so to configure them go to Options &gt; Hotkeys ; Then to your left hand side you should click a town center, lumbercamp, etc. to assign any hotkeys to the technologies/upgrades</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1100" src="" alt="hotkeying technologies upgrades" width="597" height="360" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-531x320.jpg 531w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-768x463.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades.jpg 1443w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-1024x617.jpg"></a></p><h2>Typing Practice</h2><p>it is crucial in any RTS game to have a decent typing speed to manage hotkeys and multi-task faster and while some of you may think they are fast typers ..</p><p>Trust me there is one way to find out <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastfingers.com</a> .Usually a fast typer has an average of <strong>60 WPM</strong> (words per minute), less than that you my friend are not a fast typer yet. Check out the video i posted at the beginning of this guide (skip to 8:57) where I took the typing test.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>For beginners, practicing hotkeys in the editor mode is certainly the fastest and best way to memorize them. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of wasting time because the reward is worthwhile.</p></p>

Port forwarding is not needed <strong>99,98%</strong> of the cases because a client server model relies mainly on TCP protocol to receive your commands and actions then the server returns a response to each player. By default TCP is always operational protocol even in Mobile broadband connections unlike UDP protocol.</p><p>The only case when you have to port forward is when your router is intentionally set to block any random TCP traffic through the firewall; or your Antivirus/firewall is blocking the server ip or traffic to that ip.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Can I play Age of Empires 2 DE with Mobile internet, would I lag?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-906 alignnone" src="" alt="Play AoE 2 DE with mobile broadband connection" width="461" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming-461x320.jpg 461w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming-461x320.jpg"></p><p>Yes! You can play using Mobile internet unless (your internet provider blocks gaming activities) but that&rsquo;s extremely rare. Lag is measured based on your internet speed and ping.</p><p>A minimum requirement is 2 MB download, 0.3 Upload and a low Ping which is also crucial to communicate with multiplayer servers.&nbsp; Because It determines how much delay you are getting in the course of the game-play. However the game is less likely to stuffer as in peer-to-peer.</p><h2>What if one or more than one player are lagging, would they affect the rest of the players?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-918 size-medium" src="" alt="multiplayer reasons to lose" width="368" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png 368w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png"></p><p>No! Whoever lags will lag himself not others. 3G internet speed of at least 2 MB download, 0.3 upload and a decent ping is the bare minimum for an average to good multiplayer experience.</p><h2>What if my internet drops for less than 60 seconds, would I get back to the game?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-908 alignnone" src="" alt="drops in aoe2 de are fixed" width="448" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop-448x320.jpg 448w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop-448x320.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes! One of the outstanding advantages of this brand-new multiplayer is the ability to get back into the game if you have dropped for less 60 seconds, therefore, other players won&rsquo;t have to save and exit then restore again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What if the servers are down, Can we play multiplayer?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-909 alignnone" src="" alt="servers are down thus multiplayer" width="430" height="228" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg 603w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-768x407.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-300x160.jpg 300w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down.jpg 950w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg"></p><p>No! When the servers are down you have to wait until they are back on to play multiplayer, however you can still play single player or watch recorded games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>In a multiplayer game, My game crashed and shut down, Can I run it again and get back to game?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-910 alignnone" src="" alt="game crashing unexpectedly" width="495" height="171" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png"></p><p>Yes! When your game shuts down while playing multiplayer, you should be able to get back to the game but you have to join in less than 60 seconds or whatever the timeout is set to. Also It depends if this feature is implemented or not however it is entirely possible to add.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Would players in a far region struggle with other regions?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-912 alignnone" src="" alt="regions and pings" width="452" height="532" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/regions-and-pings-1.png"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Australia, and Asia may get 500 &ndash; 200 ping with Europe+North Africa/America regions. It always has been like that but at least the pings have the potential to be way better than the peer-to-peer version. I expect server coverage for every region so low pings are guaranteed, except the south African region which has been challenging for them to get any multiplayer coverage in the last years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Would there be live profile stats for players on the internet?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-913 size-full" src="" alt="live game stats for aoe 2 de" width="479" height="448" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png 479w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287-342x320.png 342w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png"></p><p>Yes, It&rsquo;s entirely possible to have your profile stats saved on your xbox profile, but the question is, have they planned it yet?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Would players be able to fake their ELO?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-915 alignnone" src="" alt="cheating in age of empires 2" width="620" height="395" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-502x320.jpg 502w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-768x490.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193.jpg 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg"></p><p>No! It&rsquo;s almost impossible. The only way to fake ELO is to deliberately cheat to earn ELO, and that should be more challenging than before. With the a presence of a good anticheat, people reporting and the live game stats; cheaters would be caught like rats in a trap.</p><h2></h2><h2>Irrelevant to multiplayer, but do I need a bigger monitor to see the game zoomed out?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-917 alignnone" src="" alt="age of empires 2 definitive x4 zoom" width="620" height="345" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-1024x569.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-576x320.jpg 576w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-768x427.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-1024x569.jpg"></p><p>No, You don&rsquo;t! Any laptop or screen profits from x4 zoom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope I have answered as many questions as possible. Feel free to ask more in the comment section and I will answer them for you.</p></p>
