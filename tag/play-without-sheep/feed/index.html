										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some may argue that stealing boars and sheep early on is unfair while some would say &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of the game&rdquo;. When I was noob I personally used to get offended when someone steals one of my boars or my last two sheep.<p>I was offended in way that I was waiting for any window of opportunity to pay them back. Occasionally my opponents asked for a pause but I didn&rsquo;t allow it. Or when they drop I did not save. Salt was coming out of my nose every time I was lamed or lose to those shenanigans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only back then I was an angry noob and didn&rsquo;t know how to play age of empires 2 without boars and sheep. Until I came across KKab replays. Those have changed my salt levels 180 degree.</p><p>In fact, I have started enjoying the game much more than previously. I was also able to pull some nasty moves; for instance this 5000 IQ boar block by me:</p><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="320" height="280" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oo8YMNqF6SA?autohide=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;controls=1&amp;fs=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;playlist=&amp;rel=1&amp;showinfo=1&amp;theme=light&amp;wmode=&amp;playsinline=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></div><p>Or surviving an ultra lamer:</p><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="320" height="280" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aBDw7p4DBGA?autohide=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;controls=1&amp;fs=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;playlist=&amp;rel=1&amp;showinfo=1&amp;theme=light&amp;wmode=&amp;playsinline=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></div><p>Today, I will be showing you how to play Age of Empires 2 without 1 or 2 boars; without 2, 4, or 6 sheep. I will also add recorded games to download at the end of every section for you to watch on Steam/Voobly. Again credits to Kkab, one of the legends of Age of empires 2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>When a Boar or Sheep steal take place?</h3><p>The boar steal usually takes place around the 3 &ndash; 6 min mark. Use this tip to have your scout nearby your boar in Patrol/Aggressive stance.</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-490" src="" alt="Patrol Command In Age of Empires 2" width="425" height="347" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Agressive-patrol.jpg 425w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Agressive-patrol-392x320.jpg 392w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Agressive-patrol.jpg"></p><p>You may be able to scare your enemy away or you can try to <strong>block his scout</strong> from stealing the boar by <strong>moving your own scout diagonally</strong> between the running boar and the enemy scout.</p><div id="attachment_495" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-495" class="wp-image-495 size-full" src="" alt="Boar Blocking In Age of Empires 2" width="580" height="333" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boar-block.jpg 580w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boar-block-557x320.jpg 557w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boar-block.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-495" class="wp-caption-text">Boar Blocking In Age of Empires 2</p></div><p>Sheep steal usually occur around <span style="color: #0000ff;">2:10</span> &ndash; <span style="color: #0000ff;">6</span> min and sometimes later. The only tip I can give you to practice scouting your base better. I recommend this guide : <a title="Step By Step Scouting For Beginners in Age of Empires 2" href="https://ageofnotes.com/beginners/step-step-scouting-beginners-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Step By Step Scouting For Beginners in Age of Empires 2</a>. It is also important to <a title="3 Effective Ways of Scouting in Age Of Empires 2" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/scout-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scout your enemy</a> so you can anticipate him and then it&rsquo;s up to you whether to play defensive or aggressive.&nbsp;However if your boar is stolen, do not panic. As throughout this guide you will learn how you can easily play without it.</p><blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> A drawback to stealing a boar is a scout with less hp. Try to chase the low hp scout and kill it, preferably when you are about to hit Feudal age. This way you reduce his scouting information then you can use that to your advantage and send a villager to build a tower behind his lumberjacks or do an unusual strategy to take him by surprise or slow him down.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How does a lamer think?</h3><p>This is really important! I may not be completely right, but at least when I play them and I have played so many of them from different skill level and play styles. What they usually try to pull is illustrated in the following scenarios:</p><div id="attachment_491" style="width: 388px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-491" class="wp-image-491 size-full" src="" alt="Scenario 1 (Boar Steal =&gt; Drush/Drush + FC)" width="378" height="248" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Boar-Steal-Scenario-1.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-491" class="wp-caption-text">Scenario 1 (Boar Steal =&gt; Drush/Drush + FC)</p></div><div id="attachment_492" style="width: 388px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-492" class="wp-image-492 size-full" src="" alt="Scenario 2 (Boar Steal =&gt; Scout Rush/Full Scout Rush)" width="378" height="230" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Boar-Steal-Scenario-2.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-492" class="wp-caption-text">Scenario 2 (Boar Steal =&gt; Scout Rush/Full Scout Rush)</p></div><div id="attachment_493" style="width: 422px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493" class="wp-image-493 size-full" src="" alt="Scenario 3 (Boar Steal =&gt; Foward Rush/Tower Rush)" width="412" height="230" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Boar-Steal-Scenario-3.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-493" class="wp-caption-text">Scenario 3 (Boar Steal =&gt; Foward Rush/Tower Rush)</p></div><div id="attachment_494" style="width: 442px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-494" class="wp-image-494" src="" alt="Scenario 4 (Boar Steal =&gt; FC + Knights/FC + Castle + UU)" width="432" height="250" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Boar-Steal-Scenario-4.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-494" class="wp-caption-text">Scenario 4 (Boar Steal =&gt; FC + Knights/FC + Castle + UU)</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From those scenarios you can tell that stealing is essentially a strategy ingredient. Therefore do not let a boar steal affect your build order, because you would be giving up an advantage to your enemy. Read the next section of this guide to learn how to recover from a stolen boar or sheep. (Recorded game lessons are available to download as well)</p><h2>How to Play without 1 Boar (Common)</h2><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484" src="" alt="" width="216" height="135" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boar-340food.jpg"></p><p>Here is how you should adapt your build order:</p><p>(Seeing the enemy stealing your boar)</p><p><strong>If you have loom (Population 12) becomes (Population 11), etc.</strong></p><p>3:20 min (12 Population) This Villager that comes out should lure the other boar (meanwhile you are consuming a sheep.</p><p>3:45 min (13 Population) Bring down the boar and now you should have 9 villagers consuming the boar. Remove 1 villager from the boar and send it to berries (you only need 8 on boar). Build a mill whenever you have 100 wood.</p><p>4:10 min (14 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 2 foragers)</p><p>4:35 min (15 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 3 foragers)</p><p>5:00 min (16 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 4 foragers)</p><p>5:25 min (17 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 5 foragers). Your boar is done now. Just start consuming sheep. And make a farm whenever you have 60 wood.</p><p>5:50 min (18 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 6 foragers)</p><p>6:15 min (19 Population) This villager takes any struggler &ldquo;tree&rdquo; near your town center. You have two farms now and need to make a third farm soon.</p><p>6:40 min (20 Population) This villager becomes a shepherd (consumes sheep as well)</p><p>7:05 min (21 Population) This villager joins lumberjacks (total 4 lumberjacks)</p><p>7&nbsp;: 30 min (22 Population) This villager also joins lumberjacks (total 5 lumberjacks); also Research Loom.</p><p>7:55 or 7:45 min (22 Population) At Loom researched! Click Feudal Age. And villagers that are done with sheep set them to take nearby struggler trees for few seconds. Then Grab 5 villagers from strugglers to build a new lumber camp. 2 Villagers left on strugglers should build a barracks at 60% &ndash; 70%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meantime you may try to find enemy scout. Because when you reach feudal age your scout becomes faster than a Dark Age scout. So you can chase it and kill it easily.</p><p>Once you reach Feudal age you can build your stable as if nothing happened. Maybe your build order is now even better with 3 farms.</p><p>Download and Watch One of The Recorded Games For a Live Example:</p><p><strong>Play Without 1 Boar Recorded Game For Steam (AoE2HD 5.8)</strong></p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Play-without-1-Boar-AoE2HD-5.8.zip" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#2D89EF;border-color:#246ec0;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px" target="_self"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 16px;font-size:13px;line-height:26px;border-color:#6cadf4;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none"> Download (AoE2HD 5.8)</span></a><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Play Without 1 Boar Recorded Game For Voobly (Userpatch 1.5 RC)</strong></p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Play-without-1-Boar-1.5-RC.zip" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#2D89EF;border-color:#246ec0;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px" target="_self"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 16px;font-size:13px;line-height:26px;border-color:#6cadf4;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none"> Download (UserPatch 1.5RC)</span></a><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Play without 2 Boars</h2><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-485" src="" alt="" width="216" height="135" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boars-680food.jpg"></p><p>There is only 1 chance out a 100 for this to happen, especially if you have 2 forward boars at the same spot.

Then you should build the first mill nearby deers, then next 100 wood build 2<sup>nd</sup> Mill on Forage Bushes. But Do Not build a second lumbercamp. (I do not recommend this because you are giving up the 2<sup>nd</sup> lumber camp which is the key to a good feudal age economy. So do your best and lure deers preferably as the recorded game suggests.)</p><p><strong>Play Without 2 Boars Recorded Game For Steam (AoE2HD 5.8)&nbsp;</strong></p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-To-Play-Without-2-Boars.zip" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#2D89EF;border-color:#246ec0;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px" target="_self"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 16px;font-size:13px;line-height:26px;border-color:#6cadf4;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none"> Download (AoE2HD 5.8)</span></a><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Play Without 2 Boars Recorded Game For Voobly (Userpatch 1.5 RC)&nbsp;</strong></p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-To-Play-Without-2-Boars-1.5-RC.zip" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#2D89EF;border-color:#246ec0;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px" target="_self"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 16px;font-size:13px;line-height:26px;border-color:#6cadf4;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none"> Download (UserPatch 1.5RC)</span></a><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Play without 2 Sheep (Common)</h2><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-486" src="" alt="" width="216" height="135" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sheep-200food.jpg"></p><p>2 sheep may not sound as much but it is <span style="color: #ff0000;">200</span> food. That&rsquo;s a lot of food lost, because Horse collar and double bit axe feudal upgrades together cost <span style="color: #ff0000;">175</span> food and 125 wood.
