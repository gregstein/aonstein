<p>Let&#8217;s understand what I mean by peer-to-peer and client server.</p>
<h2>Peer to Peer Vs Client Server</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-900 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ageofempires2-lag-multiplayer-e1560096858294.jpg" alt="Multiplayer lag in Age of Empires 2 hd" width="545" height="302" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ageofempires2-lag-multiplayer-e1560096858294.jpg 588w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ageofempires2-lag-multiplayer-e1560096858294-577x320.jpg 577w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></p>
<p>I will give straight forward examples to paint the picture. To give these examples meaning, I have made up two players from my imagination to help you understand easier:<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>has a high ping (bad internet) and slow computer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player has a low ping (good internet) and fast computer.</p>
<h3>Peer to Peer</h3>
<p><strong>Peer to Peer</strong> Multiplayer e.g.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific</span> is playing against <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span>. Peer-to-Peer network resultsÂ  ==&gt; <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player with good internet/computer is impacted severely by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>player ping and computer lag. End results, the game lags for everyone.</p>
<p>Explanation: <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player awaits actions and commands to be executed and sent from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>(the lagger), and that takes a long time (1, 2, 10, etc. seconds) &#8211; this is the definition of network lag.</p>
<h3>Client-Server</h3>
<p><strong>Client Server</strong> Multiplayer e.g.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>is playing against <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span>. Client Server network result ==&gt; <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player is enjoying game after another without any lag impact from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>the lagger.</p>
<p>Explanation: Actions and commands executed by both players <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>and <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> are decided by the server; therefore, <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> will have a clear advantage over <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>if ever the game goes down to micro.</p>
<h3>Who wins?</h3>
<p>To conclude, Client Server multiplayer rewards players with good internet connection and decent computer. Peer-to-Peer punishes all players when one of players is lagging.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Client Server wins.</span></strong></p>
<p>We will soon find out later today on E3 Expo&#8230;</p>
<h3>Good News and Conclusion</h3>
<p>As of today and after 4 days, It has been confirmed by <a href="https://www.aoezone.net/threads/june-12-17-45-gmt-aoe2-de-first-live-stream-with-cysion.156330/page-3#post-621888" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cysion in this post</a> that Age of Empires 2 DE will be getting Client Server multiplayer. Finally we can put the struggle of those laggy multiplayer behind us.</p>
