<h3 align="left">Secrets To Master 5 Militias Drush</h3>
<p align="left">Coupled with memorizing the Raw build (previously illustrated), Tips and the Military Timeline will make it easier for you to nail the 5 Militia Drush to perfection.</p>
<p align="left">Starting with the Military Timeline depicting when exactly you should be building army. Make no mistake of dishonoring the timeline as everything is calculated in this build, you&#8217;ve got to queue army constantly except the times when you are planning to go up to the next age or save up for an upgrade.</p>

<h3 align="left">Feudal Age Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>At Feudal Age Researched:</strong> Research economic upgrades <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/202.png" alt="Double Bit Axe" width="48" height="48" />Double-Bit Axe &amp; <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14.png" alt="Horse Collar" width="48" height="48" />Horse Collar.

<li><strong>While Military Structures are being built:</strong> Villagers queued from your Town Center become farmers and so the foragers after bushes are depleted. Your goal is to achieve at least 12 farms or preferable 14 farms at 14 mins</li>
<li><strong>At Blacksmith built:</strong> <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/199.png" alt="Fletching" width="48" height="48" />Research Fletching</li>
<li><strong>At 14:30 mins:</strong> Either build more farms OR another Archery Range or a Stable.</li>
<li><strong>At 15:00 mins:</strong> Assign villagers queued from the Town Center to your gold mines.</li>
<li><strong>At 16 mins:</strong> Research <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/213.png" alt="wheelbarrow upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Wheelbarrow</li>
<li><strong>At 17 mins:</strong> Stop queuing archers to save up gold for clicking up.</li>
<li><strong>At 18 – 19 mins:</strong> Click up to <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/castle_age_de-e1614782670827.png" alt="castle age button" width="48" height="48" />Castle Age (Idle your town center if necessary to acquire 800 food)</li>
<li><strong>At 50% Towards Castle Age:</strong> Research <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/55.png" alt="gold mining upgrade" width="48" height="48" /> Gold mining upgrade &amp; Add another Archery Range</li>

<h3 align="left">Castle Age Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>At 80% Towards Castle Age:</strong> Send 2 villagers forward near or behind the enemy crucial resources (preferably gold, alternatively wood) or military structures</li>
<li><strong>At Castle Age Researched:</strong> Research <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/200.png" alt="Bodkin Arrow upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Bodkin Arrow, <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crossbowman-upgrade.png" alt="crossbowman upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Crossbowmen, <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/203.png" alt="BowSaw Upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Bow-Saw. Use those 2 villagers to build a Siege workshop. Build a new Town Center near your gold miners to protect them.</li>
<li><strong>Before 24 mins:</strong> Build a second Town Center around 20 – 24 mins (building it later than that delays your economy)</li>
<li><strong>At 27 mins:</strong> Build a University and research <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/93.png" alt="ballistics upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Balistics.</li>
<li><strong>At 30 mins:</strong> You need at least 27 farmers but preferably 30 Farmers.</li>
<li><strong>Around 31 – 32 mins:</strong> Click up to <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/imperial_age_de-e1614783183261.png" alt="imperial age button" width="48" height="48" />Imperial Age</li>

</ol>
<h2 align="left">Transitions</h2>
<p align="left">Given the dark age economy of this build, any transition is viable. In this section, I will help you tweak your economy to smoothen your transition to any unit combo you desire.</p>
<h3 align="left">Full Scouts</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1269 size-full" title="Full Scouts Transition" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Scouts-Transition.jpg" alt="Full Scouts Transition" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Scouts-Transition.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Scouts-Transition-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">By default in our build we click up to feudal age with 5 or 6 farmers, but assuming you would like to transition into a full scouts build. You will need at least 9, 10 or 11 farmers before you reach Feudal Age meaning your lumberjacks should be only 8 (but no less than 8).</p>
<p align="left">So if you wish to have 10 or 11 farmers simply remove 1 or 2 foragers and assign them as farmers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At Feudal Age:</strong> Build 1 stable, upgrade wood and food. (Start queuing scouts non-stop)</li>
<li><strong>At 175 wood:</strong> Build 2<sup>nd</sup> stable. (Keep spamming scouts)</li>
<li><strong>At 100 gold:</strong> Research <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/435.png" alt="Bloodlines upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Bloodlines</li>
<li><strong>At 14 – 15 Farmers:</strong> Build a blacksmith</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Keep focusing on queuing nonstop scouts &amp; over farming. Spam Farms nonstop!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At 17 – 19 mins:</strong> Research <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/213.png" alt="wheelbarrow upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Wheelbarrow</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You have the freedom to stay longer in feudal age and spam scouts all day long. Or try to go up to Castle age if you feel like you can’t do much damage.</p>
<h3 align="left">Full Feudal</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1270 size-full" title="Full Feudal Transition" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Feudal-Transition.jpg" alt="Full Feudal Transition" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Feudal-Transition.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Feudal-Transition-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></p>
<p align="left">This build has great synergy with a full Feudal age transition. In fact the build remains intact until 13 mins..</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At 13:30 mins:</strong> Build 1<sup>st</sup> stable.</li>
<li><strong>At 14:30 mins:</strong> Build 2<sup>nd</sup> Archery Range.</li>
<li><strong>At 16:00 mins:</strong> Build 2<sup>nd</sup> Stable.</li>
<li><strong>At 17 – 19 mins:</strong> Research<img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/213.png" alt="wheelbarrow upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Wheelbarrow</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">The aim of Full feudal is to keep spamming: Archers, Skirmishers, Scouts, Spearmen. Then raid your opponent and take as many engages as possible, considering that your units have all or most of these upgrades:</p>
<div id="attachment_1263" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/full-feudal-upgrades-to-research.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1263" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1263 size-full" title="full feudal upgrades to research" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/full-feudal-upgrades-to-research.jpg" alt="full feudal upgrades to research" width="300" height="150" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1263" class="wp-caption-text">Full Feudal Military Upgrades to Research</p></div>
<p align="left">Full feudal wars usually hit 28 – 30 mins before clicking up to Castle Age. So be prepared for a long war and spam military units non-stop. Don&#8217;t give up!</p>
<h3 align="left">Tower Rush (Trush)</h3>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tower-Rush-Transition.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1268 size-full" title="Tower Rush Transition" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tower-Rush-Transition.jpg" alt="Tower Rush Transition" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tower-Rush-Transition.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tower-Rush-Transition-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">Hmm, hmm! When you spot your opponent walling like a maniac before 10 mins. Your reaction is to build a mine camp with 3 villagers near any accessible stone piles exactly by the time you click up to feudal age which is 10 mins. You will have only 9 Lumberjacks instead of 12.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At 40% Feudal Age:</strong> Pull 4 foragers and send them forward.</li>
<li><strong>At Feudal Age Researched:</strong> Build one lonely stable at Home. Build a Tower with your forward villagers behind any crucial resource.</li>
<li><strong>At 150 wood available:</strong> Build a blacksmith (Research <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/199.png" alt="Fletching" width="48" height="48" />Fletching to increase tower range and damage.)</li>
<li><strong>At 150 Food 100 Gold available:</strong> Research <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/435.png" alt="Bloodlines upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Bloodlines in the stable.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">The plan is pretty simple, spam towers, scouts and a few spears in an attempt to burst through the walls into his base. Just don’t give up!</p>
<p align="left">
<h2 align="left">How To Counter Other Strategies?</h2>
<h3 align="left">Counter a Scout Rush</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1266" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/full-scouts-raiding-party.jpg" alt="counter a full scout rush build" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://ageofnotes.com/strategies/scout-rush-build-order-secrets-step-step/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scout rushes</a> are not all the same. Some like to click up with 20 pop around (7:20 mins), or 21 pop (7:36 mins), or 22 pop (8:03 mins) or even 23 pop (8:23 mins). I would only worry about 20 and 21 pop because these benchmarks let your opponent hit feudal at 9:30 mins.</p>
<p align="left">Assuming your opponent went for a 20 or 21 pop. His stable will be built and ready to queue scouts at 10:05 mins. By 12:00 mins, he will have a total of 3 to 4 scouts. You should be fine if he decides to defend his base from your militias; but problematic if he heads to your base straight forward.</p>
<p align="left">So the first question is…</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Which Civilizations usually go for a 20 or 21 pop ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mongols</li>
<li>Persians</li>
<li>Huns</li>
<li>Franks</li>
<li>Indians</li>
<li>Khmer</li>
<li>Slavs</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Second question…</p>

<p align="left"><strong>How to defend your base against 3-4 scouts at 12 mins?</strong></p>
<p align="left">The only con of this build is the fact that we hit Feudal age around 12 mins. Basically within the timespan of 12 to 13 mins, we are more or less vulnerable. To overcome this vulnerability we have two options:</p>
<blockquote><p>Keep harassing your opponent with the 5 militias until 11:00 mins then retreat to defend at home. (queue 1 Spearman before upgrading to <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/men-at-arms-upgrade-e1614780237128.png" alt="" width="49" height="49" />men at arms)</p></blockquote>
<p>OR</p>
<blockquote><p>Create (3 &#8211; 4) new militias and keep them garrisoned inside the barracks until 12 mins. Now use them to defend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p align="left">There is always a third options but probably risky:</p>

<p align="left">5 Militias Drush is a counter-build to Drushes &amp; Men at arms. You can easily proceed with the build as it is. However playing defensive instead of aggressive in feudal age is likely more rewarding, especially against archer sneaks. Feel free to research Town Watch to increase the line of sight around your base.</p>
<p align="left">The kind of upgrades you never want to miss are:<img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/199.png" alt="Fletching" width="48" height="48" />Fletching and <img loading="lazy" class="rtech" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/211.png" alt="Padded Armor upgrade" width="48" height="48" />Padded Archer Armor. The only situation when you can ignore the armor upgrade is when your opponent has barely any army.</p>
<p align="left">But bear in mind that if you scout your opponent laying down huge walls left and right. It’s no brainer that he’s intending to go Castle Age asap. Logically, you can react with instant aggression of towers and a spam of scout. Or simply be the king of monkeys and do the same thing.</p>
<h3 align="left">Counter Forward Rush</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1274" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Forward.jpg" alt="Counter Forward Rush" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Forward.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Forward-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></p>
<p align="left">Forwards are extremely rare since the release of AoE2 DE. And it’s safe to say that our 5 Militias build is not only a hard counter, but also an instant gg to your opponent if you catch his villagers off guard half way; hence the reason for I recommended previously to use the Barrack’s rally point near any forward enemy resource.</p>
<p align="left">The best way to deal with forwards is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spot the enemy villagers</li>
<li>Use both Militias and (4 or 5) of your own villagers to scare away or deny your opponent forward.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Skirmishers &amp; men at arms are the best combo to deal with a forward in the early phase. Later on you can switch to archers or scouts depending on feels like the right call.</p>
<h3 align="left">Counter Archers</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1273" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Archers.jpg" alt="Counter Archers" width="643" height="423" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Archers.jpg 643w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Counter-Archers-486x320.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></p>
<p align="left">Countering pure archer builds, such 22 or 23 pop double archery range, comes down to how good you did with your 5 militias starting from <strong>09:00 mins</strong> onwards. Denying his gold miners should your priority number 1, wood lines come as a second priority then the foragers.</p>
<p align="left">Often you want to take what you can get, be it foragers, gold miners, deer hunters or lumberjacks. And that is totally fine as long as you’ll switch your raiding focus later on to only harassing gold miners and lumberjacks.</p>
<p align="left">At Feudal age, build 1 archery range and a blacksmith then fully commit to skirmishers. In fact as soon as you research fletching you can pull your gold miners from gold then assign them as farmers. You want to “farm hard and skirm hard”. Do not even bother with archers unless he goes for a stable or you wish to transition to Crossbows. Either way going for a stable yourself isn’t a bad idea at all.</p>

<h2 align="left">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This build order synergizes better with 3 Civilizations: &#x2705;Huns, &#x2705;Persians, &amp; &#x2705;Britons. But keep in mind that &#x26d4;Bulgarians &amp; &#x26d4;Spanish lack Crossbowman upgrade, so if you ever pick them &#8211; Think anything but archers. Apart from these two exceptions, it&#8217;s safe to say the build order works well with the rest of the civilizations.</p>
<p>Be a nice to your opponent and have fun &#x2764;&#xfe0f;</p>
