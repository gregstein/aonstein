[wp_ad_camp_4]
</p><p>Now you must be wondering.. What Should I do at Castle Age?</p><p>Upon reaching Castle Age, you must make the wisest decisions depending on what your opponent is doing. And the best way i see fit to help you is Q&amp;A approach.</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: My enemy is going for a Scout Rush, what to do ?</span></p><p>
<div id="attachment_1060" style="width: 428px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1060" class=" wp-image-1060" src="" alt="Good usage of spearman to protect against Scouts" width="418" height="277" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Spearmen-guarding-gold-forage-bushes.jpg 777w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Spearmen-guarding-gold-forage-bushes-483x320.jpg 483w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Spearmen-guarding-gold-forage-bushes-768x509.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Spearmen-guarding-gold-forage-bushes.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-1060" class="wp-caption-text">Good usage of spear-men to protect against Scouts</p></div>
</p><p><span style="color: #008000;">A:</span> Scout rush usually hits your base at 12:30 or 13 mins with 3 &ndash; 4 scouts. You will need 1 or 2 spears at all vulnerable spots. For example I like to have:</p><ul>
<li>Gold Miners guarded by: <strong>2 Spears</strong></li>
<li>Lumberjacks guarded by: <strong>1 Spear</strong> at 12 mins then <strong>2 Spears</strong> at 13&rsquo;ish mins ( Use your villagers to attack enemy scouts along with your spears)</li>
<li>Foragers can be easily sent back to Town Center or use the <strong>same spears</strong> from your wood line.</li>
</ul><h4>Two Rules to follow in order to take less damage possible from scout rush</h4><ol>
<li>Never chase 3 or 4 scouts with 1 Spear (Unless most of them are low hp)</li>
<li>Always send at least 2 spear-men with your archers to attack the enemy before castle age.</li>
</ol><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: Should I engage skirmishers?</span></p><p>
<div id="attachment_1061" style="width: 304px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1061" class="size-full wp-image-1061" src="" alt="Skirmisher with fletching upgrade" width="294" height="143" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Skirmisher-with-fletching.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-1061" class="wp-caption-text">Skirmisher with Fletching upgrade</p></div>
</p><p><span style="color: #339966;">A:</span> You can engage only if they don&rsquo;t have +1 Attack (Fletching) while you have it. To find out, click an enemy Skirmisher and check if his attack is only 2 (not 2 + 1) because 2 + 1 means he has fletching . See image below (You can use high ground and hills to gain an extra +1 attack when fighting enemy army)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: What If my opponent has many skirmishers while I&rsquo;m going up to Castle Age?</span></p><p><img class=" wp-image-1062 alignnone" src="" alt="Counter Skirmishers with Knights or Mangonels" width="428" height="182" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/countering-skirms.jpg"></p><p><span style="color: #339966;">A:</span> At 50% Before hitting Castle Age, sneak in 2 villagers to build a siege workshop near your enemy base. Use Mangonels to land some good shots or scare him away. Meantime your Crossbows are picking off villagers. Or instead of building a siege workshop you can build a stable and make 2 knights to clean all the skirmishers.</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Q: What if my opponent is fully walled since feudal age and has stables?</span></p><p><img class="wp-image-1063 alignnone" src="" alt="walled enemy" width="505" height="262" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy-617x320.jpg 617w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy-768x398.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/walled-enemy.jpg"></p><p><span style="color: #339966;">A:</span> Stables usually mean knights play. To counter that you must decide whether you go for an all-in or economic style. I will explain them both:</p><p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">All-in Style? </span>(No additional Town Centers but continue farming and building army and villagers non-stop</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p>Build a second barracks once you click up to Castle Age and queue both archers and spears. Research Plate armor for spears. Once you reach Castle Age, upgrade to Pikeman and Crossbows simultaneously.</p><p>Go forward with your army and 2 villagers then build a siege workshop near your enemy base and force fights and take down military buildings using rams or Mangonels. Preferably ram down Town centers if you can. <span style="color: #008000;">Most importantly never stop making army until you win or get significantly ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_5]
</p><p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Economic Style? </span>(Add 2 extra Town Centers and prioritize economic tasks and upgrades over military until you have enough villagers to support whatever plan you have in mind.)</strong></p><p>Once you reach Castle Age; upgrade to Crossbowmen; Build a monastery and 2 Town Centers. Use monks to convert his knights or scare him away. If the enemy builds a siege workshop you also build a defensive siege workshop. <span style="color: #008000;">Focus your energy on improving your economy and queuing more villagers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If he commits to knights you can either build an extra archery range and a university to research Ballistics then start sniping his knights one by one. Or Switch to Pikemen to defend your base and go up to imperial age first. At Imperial Age, if you civilization has access to Arbalests it&rsquo;ll be just easier to end up the game. Or Halberdiers Or Unique units or Paladins.. Whatever your civilization excels at use it.</p><p>

Wait for it&hellip; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><del><strong>Focusing on Villager kills</strong></del></span></p><p>While Killing a few villagers throughout the course of the game may set you ahead for several minutes&hellip; But honestly It&rsquo;s not enough against an opponent that focuses on the objectives of his build order.</p><p>A very common example which I have witnessed while spectating lower tier players: They had an army lead and a score lead since 12:00 mins to 20 mins. They even got 5 or 7 villager kills but still lost in Castle age.</p><p><strong>How? Why? <span style="color: #008000;">They have been behind economically by 7 &ndash; 8 farms at 16 mins or over mining gold.</span></strong></p><p>Without Further Redo let me unveil the secret goals of a 23 pop archers that no living pro has ever told you:</p><h4>1- Do not randomly attack any resource</h4><p><img class="wp-image-1051 alignnone" src="" alt="calculate your rushing abilities" width="487" height="209" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/calculate-every-move.jpg 700w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/calculate-every-move-622x267.jpg 622w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/calculate-every-move.jpg"></p><p>Your every moves must be calculated and based on the strategy that the enemy is going for and based on current time..

If you can&rsquo;t attack (3)lumberjacks</p><p><strong>@16:00 &ndash; 17:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners. If you can&rsquo;t only then attack (2)lumberjacks. If you can&rsquo;t attack (3)farmers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Against a Drush/Drush FC</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1056 alignnone" src="" alt="militias dark age rush (Drush)" width="352" height="247" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/militias-drush.jpg 530w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/militias-drush-455x320.jpg 455w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/militias-drush.jpg"></p><p><strong>@11:00 &ndash; 13:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners .

(No value attacking farmers at this point)</p><p><strong>@16:00 &ndash; 19:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners. If you can&rsquo;t only then attack (2)Lumberjacks. If you can&rsquo;t attack (3)Farmers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Against Men At Arms</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1058 alignnone" src="" alt="men at arms play" width="355" height="250" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/men-at-arms.jpg 530w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/men-at-arms-455x320.jpg 455w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/men-at-arms.jpg"></p><p><strong>@11:00 &ndash; 13:00 mins:</strong> Attack Gold Miners or Lumberjacks first or (2) Stone miners if found.</p><p><strong>@14:00 &ndash; 19:00 mins:</strong> Attack (1)Gold Miners. If you can&rsquo;t only then attack (2)Lumberjacks. If you can&rsquo;t only then Attack (3)Farmers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extended Tips:</p><ul>
<li>Idling enemy gold miners for a few seconds then running away with your army is better than getting 1 or 2 kills.</li>
<li>Killing 1 enemy gold miner is better than killing 1 lumberjack.</li>
</ul><h4>2- Force Enemy to Build defenses</h4><p><img class=" wp-image-1052 alignnone" src="" alt="force the enemy to build defences" width="417" height="250" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/force-enemy-build-defences.jpg 561w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/force-enemy-build-defences-534x320.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/force-enemy-build-defences.jpg"></p><p>Yet another trick to set your enemy behind is to force him to:</p><ul>
<li>Build a defensive Tower ( Later in castle age he can&rsquo;t build town centers which forces him to mine stone too and that is good for you)</li>
<li>Build Skirmishers &amp; Spears ( The more skirmishers/spears the enemy makes the more delayed to Castle age he will be. Simply go Castle age faster for the win)</li>
</ul><h4>3- Keep fights away from Your Town</h4><p><img class=" wp-image-1053 alignnone" src="" alt="Fighting near enemy base" width="473" height="283" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fighting-in-enemy-base.jpg 561w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fighting-in-enemy-base-534x320.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fighting-in-enemy-base.jpg"></p><p>I can not stress enough on the cruciality of initiating fights or engaging fights while at your opponent base or away from your own base. That way and first of all in case things go wrong enemy units can&rsquo;t rush into your base straight up in one glimpse of an eye. Then second You can split your army to cause chaos.</p><h5>A little distraction</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1054 alignnone" src="" alt="2 Archers behind a wood line" width="477" height="249" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/archers-behind-wood-line.jpg 750w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/archers-behind-wood-line-614x320.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/archers-behind-wood-line.jpg"></p><p>Put <span style="color: #339966;">1 or 2 archers behind his wood line</span> somewhere it takes him time to reach while you attack gold miners or farmers. If he chases your army and ignores that 1 or 2 archers; at that point your 1 or 2 archers have overdone their work.</p><p>

For example:</p><ul>
<li><strong> Mongols:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18, 19 or 20 pop. Food is gathered 40% faster from Boars/Deers or any hunted animals .</li>
<li><strong>Britons:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18 or 19 pop. Sheep and goats food is gathered 25% faster <del>not turkeys or Cows</del>.</li>
<li><strong>Khmer:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 19 or 20 pop then skip building Barracks to build double archery ranges instead.</li>
<li><strong>Lithuanians:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 18 or 19 pop due to +150 Dark Age food bonus.</li>
<li><strong>Huns:</strong> Can click Feudal Age around 19 pop and since they do not need houses you will save up enough wood for Archery Ranges.</li>
<li><strong>Malay:</strong> Can click Feudal Age as late as 22 pop yet They reach Feudal age 66% faster. And that counts as 20 pop.</li>

</ul><h4>Sneaky Archery Ranges</h4><p><img class=" wp-image-1064 alignnone" src="" alt="sneaky archery ranges" width="469" height="313" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-479x320.jpg 479w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-768x513.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers.jpg 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sneaky-archers-1024x684.jpg"></p><p>The idea is as simple as it sounds. Send two villagers forward to build double archery ranges behind, right or left hand side your opponent. Be as stealthy as you can in order to catch your enemy off guard with an early 6 archers with Fletching.</p><p>If you are caught in the process of building the archery ranges well that could be pickle to deal with. Often the enemy will pull villagers to wall in your archery ranges or tower them. Or they can respond with an early Archery range and counter you with 6 to 11 skirmishers then go up to castle age faster than you.</p><p>In this situation, you are looking at one option:&nbsp; Full Feudal Age war. Send 3 villagers to stone and build a stable then mix in both archers and skirmishers + scouts and build towers as soon as you bank 125 stone. To succeed with your Full Feudal war you must over farm and focus on Food and Wood resources primarily. Meaning..</p><ul>
<li>Do not exceed 4 Stone miners</li>
<li>Do not exceed 4 to 6 Gold Miners</li>
</ul><h4>Benchmarks For Raiding Your Opponent</h4><h5>Tiny Attack (2 Archers + 2 Spears)</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1065 alignnone" src="" alt="2 archers and 2 spears tiny rush" width="346" height="172" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-archers-2-spears.jpg"></p><p>At 12:00 &ndash; 12:30 mins, This tiny attack is meant to stop an opponent from walling or idle his economy a little too early. It is most effective against a Scout rush build. Most importantly, DO NOT lose this tiny army trying to get 1 kill. We have discussed previously that idling enemy villagers is more worthy than killing 1 or 2 villagers.</p><p>

Focus on Idling Economy.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
</p><h5>Small Attack (6 &ndash; 8 Archers)</h5><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1066 " src="" alt="6 archers + fletching being researched" width="328" height="215" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-archers.jpg"></p><p>Around 14:30 mins, you should move out with 6 archers (+2 spears against Scouts play). You must focus this small attack on enemy gold miners but if you can not only then attack his lumberjacks or farmers. Do not over stay if the enemy has army of his own. Again it&rsquo;s not worth to lose your army for 2 kills; However forcing him to hide villagers for a few seconds then run away is&nbsp; mostly worth it.</p><p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Use Hit and Run tactics. Sneak your archers from different angles and corners. Get kills when you can. Try to keep your army as alive as you can.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
</p><h5>Main Attack ( 12 &ndash; 20)</h5><p><img class=" wp-image-1067 alignnone" src="" alt="19 archers" width="482" height="385" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19-archers.jpg 666w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19-archers-401x320.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19-archers.jpg"></p><p>By <strong>17:00 mins</strong>, your army count should be over 12 archers and&hellip; Have you saved those <strong>6 &ndash; 8 Archers</strong> from the previous small attack? That would make your army even stronger and larger in number. If necessary you can go for the Padded Archer Armor upgrade to improve the resistance of your archers against enemy units such as Skirmishers and Scouts.</p><ul>
<li>Against a greedy and walled enemy you can split your army then attack from different angles as long as he does not have a scary army to cut you off with.</li>
<li>Against an enemy with a considerable army size or a combo of archers and scouts. You must be cautious not to walk into your death by shoving your army without scouting information about where enemy army is located. In fact I would recommend you to focus on idling your town center to save up enough food to go up to Castle Age. Once at Castle Age first; feel free to shove into your opponent base with crossbowmen and micro your way in.</li>
</ul><p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Losing your archers before Castle age is a suicide. Rather wait to upgrade to Crossbowmen to deal maximum damage.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Tips</h2><p>23 Pop Archers is certainly a viable build order in any tier or skill level. Just learn to do some efficient walling to be ready against the worst of it. Do not forget that the biggest point of weakness of this build is<strong> Gold Miners.&nbsp;</strong>Build your military structures in front of your gold mines and prioritize protection first and foremost to your gold miners. Then your Woodline.</p><p>One more tip, watch replays you lost and talk to yourself what you could have done better. Because next time you will react to those situation without second thoughts.</p></p>
