										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might not realize this, but the brand-new &#8220;server-sided&#8221; multiplayer we are getting, <a href="https://www.aoezone.net/threads/retitled-aoe2-des-multiplayer-will-be-server-based-cysion.156330/page-3#post-621888" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reported by Cysion</a>, in Age of Empires 2 Definitive will completely eliminate lag whether in 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4. To understood further <a title="Will Age of Empires 2 Definitive Get Better Multiplayer?" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/will-age-of-empires-2-definitive-get-better-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how a client server multiplayer works</a>; I have prepared a question/answer draft where I answer most of the queries that may have come across your mind.</p>
<h2>Do I need to do port forwarding?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-905 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/port-forwarding.png" alt="Port forwarding" width="463" height="266" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/port-forwarding.png 838w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/port-forwarding-556x320.png 556w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/port-forwarding-768x442.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" /></p>
<p>No! Port forwarding is not needed <strong>99,98%</strong> of the cases because a client server model relies mainly on TCP protocol to receive your commands and actions then the server returns a response to each player. By default TCP is always operational protocol even in Mobile broadband connections unlike UDP protocol.</p>
<p>The only case when you have to port forward is when your router is intentionally set to block any random TCP traffic through the firewall; or your Antivirus/firewall is blocking the server ip or traffic to that ip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can I play Age of Empires 2 DE with Mobile internet, would I lag?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-906 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming-461x320.jpg" alt="Play AoE 2 DE with mobile broadband connection" width="461" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming-461x320.jpg 461w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mobile-connection-gaming.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p>Yes! You can play using Mobile internet unless (your internet provider blocks gaming activities) but that&#8217;s extremely rare. Lag is measured based on your internet speed and ping.</p>
<p>A minimum requirement is 2 MB download, 0.3 Upload and a low Ping which is also crucial to communicate with multiplayer servers.Â  Because It determines how much delay you are getting in the course of the game-play. However the game is less likely to stuffer as in peer-to-peer.</p>
<h2>What if one or more than one player are lagging, would they affect the rest of the players?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-918 size-medium" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png" alt="multiplayer reasons to lose" width="368" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png 368w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></p>
<p>No! Whoever lags will lag himself not others. 3G internet speed of at least 2 MB download, 0.3 upload and a decent ping is the bare minimum for an average to good multiplayer experience.</p>
<h2>What if my internet drops for less than 60 seconds, would I get back to the game?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-908 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop-448x320.jpg" alt="drops in aoe2 de are fixed" width="448" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop-448x320.jpg 448w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes! One of the outstanding advantages of this brand-new multiplayer is the ability to get back into the game if you have dropped for less 60 seconds, therefore, other players won&#8217;t have to save and exit then restore again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What if the servers are down, Can we play multiplayer?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-909 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg" alt="servers are down thus multiplayer" width="430" height="228" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg 603w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-768x407.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-300x160.jpg 300w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down.jpg 950w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></p>
<p>No! When the servers are down you have to wait until they are back on to play multiplayer, however you can still play single player or watch recorded games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In a multiplayer game, My game crashed and shut down, Can I run it again and get back to game?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-910 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png" alt="game crashing unexpectedly" width="495" height="171" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /></p>
<p>Yes! When your game shuts down while playing multiplayer, you should be able to get back to the game but you have to join in less than 60 seconds or whatever the timeout is set to. Also It depends if this feature is implemented or not however it is entirely possible to add.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Would players in a far region struggle with other regions?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-912 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/regions-and-pings-1.png" alt="regions and pings" width="452" height="532" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia, and Asia may get 500 &#8211; 200 ping with Europe+North Africa/America regions. It always has been like that but at least the pings have the potential to be way better than the peer-to-peer version. I expect server coverage for every region so low pings are guaranteed, except the south African region which has been challenging for them to get any multiplayer coverage in the last years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Would there be live profile stats for players on the internet?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-913 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png" alt="live game stats for aoe 2 de" width="479" height="448" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png 479w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287-342x320.png 342w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></p>
<p>Yes, It&#8217;s entirely possible to have your profile stats saved on your xbox profile, but the question is, have they planned it yet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Would players be able to fake their ELO?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-915 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg" alt="cheating in age of empires 2" width="620" height="395" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-502x320.jpg 502w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-768x490.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193.jpg 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>No! It&#8217;s almost impossible. The only way to fake ELO is to deliberately cheat to earn ELO, and that should be more challenging than before. With the a presence of a good anticheat, people reporting and the live game stats; cheaters would be caught like rats in a trap.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Irrelevant to multiplayer, but do I need a bigger monitor to see the game zoomed out?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-917 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-1024x569.jpg" alt="age of empires 2 definitive x4 zoom" width="620" height="345" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-1024x569.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-576x320.jpg 576w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-768x427.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>No, You don&#8217;t! Any laptop or screen profits from x4 zoom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope I have answered as many questions as possible. Feel free to ask more in the comment section and I will answer them for you.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s understand what I mean by peer-to-peer and client server.</p>
<h2>Peer to Peer Vs Client Server</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-900 alignnone" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ageofempires2-lag-multiplayer-e1560096858294.jpg" alt="Multiplayer lag in Age of Empires 2 hd" width="545" height="302" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ageofempires2-lag-multiplayer-e1560096858294.jpg 588w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ageofempires2-lag-multiplayer-e1560096858294-577x320.jpg 577w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></p>
<p>I will give straight forward examples to paint the picture. To give these examples meaning, I have made up two players from my imagination to help you understand easier:<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>has a high ping (bad internet) and slow computer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player has a low ping (good internet) and fast computer.</p>
<h3>Peer to Peer</h3>
<p><strong>Peer to Peer</strong> Multiplayer e.g.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific</span> is playing against <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span>. Peer-to-Peer network resultsÂ  ==&gt; <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player with good internet/computer is impacted severely by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>player ping and computer lag. End results, the game lags for everyone.</p>
<p>Explanation: <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player awaits actions and commands to be executed and sent from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>(the lagger), and that takes a long time (1, 2, 10, etc. seconds) &#8211; this is the definition of network lag.</p>
<h3>Client-Server</h3>
<p><strong>Client Server</strong> Multiplayer e.g.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>is playing against <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span>. Client Server network result ==&gt; <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player is enjoying game after another without any lag impact from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>the lagger.</p>
<p>Explanation: Actions and commands executed by both players <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>and <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> are decided by the server; therefore, <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> will have a clear advantage over <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>if ever the game goes down to micro.</p>
<h3>Who wins?</h3>
<p>To conclude, Client Server multiplayer rewards players with good internet connection and decent computer. Peer-to-Peer punishes all players when one of players is lagging.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Client Server wins.</span></strong></p>
<p>We will soon find out later today on E3 Expo&#8230;</p>
<h3>Good News and Conclusion</h3>
<p>As of today and after 4 days, It has been confirmed by <a href="https://www.aoezone.net/threads/june-12-17-45-gmt-aoe2-de-first-live-stream-with-cysion.156330/page-3#post-621888" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cysion in this post</a> that Age of Empires 2 DE will be getting Client Server multiplayer. Finally we can put the struggle of those laggy multiplayer behind us.</p>
