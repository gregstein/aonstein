That essentially makes much sense Jineapple! As you said Ctrl+A+A is somehow cheating and unfair. Nevertheless, if you put it into practice against MQ(Multiqueue)... Multiqueue wins.

Jineapple, do you know why everyone uses those macros? the hotkeys in Age of Empires 2 are lousy and boring somehow... I am not sure if you have looked into SC2 hotkeys...Oh boy, those fancy hotkeys!! You can do so much and it&#039;s like the game itself is &quot;Hotkey user-friendly&quot;. They woe me lol and I just feel jealous when not seeing such hotkeys in AOE2.

Bottomline, you are doubtlessly right about the fairness of using macros. They are unfair.]]></description>

There&#039;s a simple rule of thumb for macros: One input, one output. So remapping a hotkey onto your mouse is fine. Ctrl+A+A is more than one input, so you shouldn&#039;t use a single macro key for it. It&#039;s true that this might not get you into trouble, but in the interest of fairness you should stick to that.]]></description>

You are absolutely right! That example of &quot;killing idle vills&quot; is sort of too much - It would take someone else 2 - 4 seconds to kill many idles whereas MBL can do that in less than a second...Unfair!

I am pretty sure one of these days.  Scripter or an equally skilled developer would figure a solution to have long macros canceled or impractical... Then....

Well, theres definitely a difference between scripts and macros, and while macros are safe to use on voobly without any consequences, theres still some discussion to which point they should be allowed.

Obviously streamers are in the focus here, since watching the screen itself is often the only to figure out if someone is using macros or not. For example MbL got criticized for using &quot;killing idle vills&quot;-macros until he explained how he uses a combination pressing delete and scrolling through the idle vills with the mouse wheel. Imo macros (virtually pressing several buttons while in fact only clicking one) shouldnt be allowed, while extra buttons shouldnt be a problem at all.

Of course theres til now no way to detect macros, but iirc scripter once said that hes aware of that problem.

Nice to see u answering so fast!]]></description>

Thank you, man! I am very happy to see interactions already starting in this post. 
I hope I understood your question well... Did you mean are they safe to use? If that was the question, then They are totally safe to use in Voobly, steam or any other platform. They are not considered cheats. 

The &quot;macro cheats&quot; are scripts that do so much more than just queue units. For instance, just like in that post you shared with us - Those cheat macros would keep the town center queuing villagers all the time, monks auto-convert, archers move away from mangonels, etc. Not anyone can make those scripts. 

Now back to the extra buttons. I myself use them It has been 3 years and Surely MBL does too. Because I could hear the clicks of his extra buttons in the stream.

The pinpoint of the extra buttons is to help you build army faster. That&#039;s pretty much it. They can&#039;t do anything else.

I hope I answered your question.
Thank you again,]]></description>
