Thanks Haris! When i&#039;m walled up and playing against cavalry civs,my response is 3 archery ranges (or 4 archery ranges as huns) + Ballistics work wonders &lt;strong&gt;[mass archers or cavalry archers nonstop. That&#039;s the answer to your question]&lt;/strong&gt;.And when I start dealing serious damage to the enemy&#039;s eco and cut off his knights only then I start adding tcs to prepare for knight transition or siege push or an all in castle age. You&#039;ll know what works best for you based on what the enemy has or is doing.

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you overwhelm him with archers or cavalry archers he usually switches to elite skirm. Therefore, a siege push with rams and mangonels is the best choice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you cut off his army but his economy is nearly untouched switching to knights + ca or xbow is the best call + Expand your eco without investing in tcs because he has no threatening army to raid you with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your castle push is not doing enough or little damage then forget about tcs and spam more units until you overspam him and kill a chunk of his eco.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The best tip i could give you is to scout his base better than scouting yourself in dark age/feudal age. That way you can attack him from different and multiple angles he would never expect or distract him from one angle and do damage from the other.

When the game swings to imperial age, remember that capped (siege) rams + armor upgraded pikes (halbs) is one of the strongest and most disgusting combos that neither archery or cavalry civilizations can deal with it so don&#039;t be afraid of planning this switch before imperial age you&#039;ll be surprised.

You have to ask yourself this how are you ever going to learn if you do not lose and take risks? Then later reflect on your decisions so next time you do it better or differently.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ageofnotes.com/strategies/23-pop-archers-build-order-step-by-step-to-destroy-ranked-queue/#comment-497&quot;&gt;Robert&lt;/a&gt;.

Np! Excellent question! Let&#039;s rephrase your question to what are the signs of an opponent attempting a quicker Castle timing?
1- Fully walled at 10 mins
2- Late to Feudal age (12 - 13 mins) means he&#039;s doing drush fast castle or naked fast castle without any opener.
3- If you scout 5 - 7 farmers near his town center around 9 or 10 mins that means he&#039;s attempting some kind of fast castle build.

Now coming back to your question what to do vs an opponent going quicker to Castle and playing scorpions?

*First solution: Stop him from mining gold by any means possible. Because the weakness of a Fast Castle denying gold income. 

Did you know that each player has access to 3 golds (one big main gold and two other patches spread nearby) just start a game vs an AI and use cheat code &#039;marco&#039; then &#039;polo&#039; and check for yourself.

So as long as you deny him from those he can not make any gold units.

*Second solution: Build an early market as soon as you scout one of the signs explained above, sell your 200 stone, build more farmers and go up to castle as fast as you can. 

Use a spear or few military to roam in front of your base checking any sneak vils to siege you forward.

before you reach castle age (80% to castle) send your archers to a different angle of your opponent base(somewhere he won&#039;t expect you). 
And once Crossbows + bodkin are researched break into his wall or go inside to snipe some vils.

Remember! Denying his gold is more worth to stop his knight or siege production. 

In your ELO, I recommend that you focus on farming harder. The most farms you have before 15 mins (13 - 16 farms) the faster you go to castle age with an huge economy. 

Best of Luck &lt;3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, Great read, thanks a lot.
Question, what do you do vs an opponent going quicker to Castle and playing scorpions ?I feel mangonels are ok to defend but a combinaison of scouts + knights quite hard.
I am currently at 1100 elo on DE.
Thanks]]></description>
