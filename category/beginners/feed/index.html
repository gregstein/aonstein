Hotkeys take a big chunk of a player&rsquo;s skill.. Check out the graph below<div id="attachment_1104" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1104" class="wp-image-1104 size-large" src="" alt="70% of your skill is hotkeys and speed" width="620" height="414" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills-480x320.jpeg 480w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Game-skills-1024x683.jpeg"><p id="caption-attachment-1104" class="wp-caption-text">70% of your skill is hotkeys and speed</p></div><p>It&rsquo;s silly of me to generate such a stupid graph but it&rsquo;s always nice to remind your brain how huge is 70%</p><p>As usually the guide will be tackled in the very little details. <strong>There is also a video version of this guide..</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAFOb-cY9YA?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" title=""></iframe></div><h2>Hotkeys Setup</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re new to the hotkey world, It&rsquo;s recommended to use one of the hotkey presets of pro players. For that reason I got you covered with a pack of hotkey files which you can either install them yourself manually or use a little app to accomplish it in glimpse of an eye.</p><h3><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Manual Method</span></h3><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">1. Download the hotkey files zip: <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hotkey-Profiles.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotkey-Profiles.zip</a></span></p><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">2. Press <kbd>Windows Button</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd></span></p><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">3. Type in: <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>%userprofile%\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE</strong></span></span></p><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">4. A folder should pop up. Now inside it you&rsquo;ll find another folder or more with random numbers e.g. </span></p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084" src="" alt="aoe2de hotkeys profiles example" width="372" height="206" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aoe2de-hotkeys-profiles-location.png"></p><p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">5. Enter those folders with the random numbers then inside &ldquo;/profile/&rdquo; folder extract the hotkey files zip inside them both &ldquo;76561198079200175&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;76561198286982586&rdquo;, but if you only have one folder it&rsquo;s ok. It should look like this</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1085" src="" alt="aoe2 hki files" width="372" height="244" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aoe2-hotkeys-hki-files.png"></p><h3>Automatic Method</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re feeling lazy to manually install the hotkey pack, you can download this little tool from here:</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HotkeyPack-DE.zip">HotkeyPack DE Tool To Install Pro Hotkeys</a></p><p>Inside the Archive there a &ldquo;<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>HotkeyPack-DE.exe</strong></span>&rdquo; file, just double click it ( no need to extract it) Then a window like this one appears:</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1087" src="" alt="" width="393" height="257" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hotkeypack-de-tool.jpg 689w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hotkeypack-de-tool-489x320.jpg 489w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hotkeypack-de-tool.jpg"></p><p>Press the install button and that&rsquo;s it. We have all these hotkey presets installed automatically.</p><h2>Units &amp; Objects</h2><p>in Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition or any previous version, we can set hotkeys to <span style="color: #339966;">4 sets of units &amp; objects</span>:</p><p><strong>1- Military Units</strong></p><p><img class="wp-image-1089 alignleft" src="" alt="military units assign hotkeys" width="347" height="200" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits.jpg 703w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits-555x320.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2- Buildings</strong></p><p><img class=" wp-image-1090 alignleft" src="" alt="buildings hotkey bindings" width="351" height="170" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-1024x495.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-622x301.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-768x371.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings.jpg 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-1024x495.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3- Workers</strong></p><p><img class=" wp-image-1091 alignleft" src="" alt="" width="352" height="168" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2.jpg 818w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2-622x297.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2-768x367.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4- Animals</strong></p><p><img class=" wp-image-1092 alignleft" src="" alt="animals hotkey binding" width="346" height="209" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals.jpg 536w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals-531x320.jpg 531w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span style="color: #000000;">How To Set a Hotkey on Unit(s) Object(s)?</span></h3><p>Use your mouse to box whatever object(s) or unit(s) you wish to hotkey then for example: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd> 1 </kbd>(select any number from 0 &ndash; 9)</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1093" src="" alt="hotkeying units with ctrl + 1" width="426" height="301" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1.jpg 598w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1-452x320.jpg 452w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1.jpg"></p><p>Now that our army above is set to number 1. There are two ways to employ this hotkey.</p><h4>Single Mouse Click On <kbd> 1 </kbd></h4><p>Only selects your units without switching camera view.</p><h4>Double Mouse Click on <kbd> 1</kbd></h4><p>Selects your units and switches the camera view at their location.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> When taking fights away from town, you can use single mouse click (number 4 for example) to select the town center and queue villagers without having to switch the camera view. Or pull your army away using the single click.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Camera &amp; Location Hotkeys</h2><p>Although Age of Empires 2 do not have dedicated camera hotkeys as those in Starcraft 2&hellip; Fortunately for us we do have cycle commands that essentially work like the camera hotkeys for example</p><div id="attachment_1094" style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1094" class="wp-image-1094" src="" alt="camera hotkeys for age of empires 2 definitive" width="635" height="410" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys.jpg 939w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys-496x320.jpg 496w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-1094" class="wp-caption-text">Cycle Commands work like camera hotkeys.</p></div><p>As long as you build a lumbercamp, mill, mining camp, or barracks. You can use go to hotkeys to switch to view to those structures.</p><p>Switch camera to:</p><p>Lumberjacks =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> (Replicate hotkey to switch to another lumbercamp location)</p><p>Foragers/Farmers =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> (Replicate hotkey to switch to another mill location)</p><p>Gold/Stone Miners =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> (Replicate hotkeys to switch to another mining camp location)</p><p>ETC. (Same thing applies to barracks, archery range, university, castles, etc.)</p><div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Abuse location hotkeys instead of moving your mouse around to save time and unnecessary moves. And keep your hand muscles more energized for important micro tasks.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Tips For Queuing Units Faster</h2><h3>Shift Hotkeys</h3><p>Shift hotkeys are a brand-new and exclusive mechanic for the definitive edition of Age of Empires 2. A basic usage of shift hotkeying is to assign any unit to a sequential of actions or tasks.</p><p>For example if you can command a villager to do 4 actions by himself:</p><ol>
<li>Build a house.</li>
<li>Consume a Forage Bush.</li>
<li>Gather Fish</li>
<li>Mine gold</li>
</ol><p><strong>How?</strong></p><div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-1" width="480" height="268" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4?_=1"></source><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4</a></video></div><ol>
<li>Select a Villager.</li>
<li>Build a house Then Hold <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key</li>
<li>Mouse Right Click on : a forage bush, fish patch, and finally gold patch.</li>
<li>Take your finger off <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key</li>
</ol><h3>Queuing Units Faster</h3><p>Queuing military units with hotkeys makes a colossal difference in the battle and between two beginner players.&nbsp; Today I will teach two methods to queue your army then choose whatever you goes with your taste.</p><p>You must first configure Select All hotkeys to suit your needs by entering Options &gt; Hotkeys &gt; Game Commands. Then scroll down to find them</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1099" src="" alt="select all hotkeys for age of empires 2 definitive edition" width="492" height="301" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-523x320.jpg 523w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-768x470.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys.jpg 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-1024x626.jpg"></a></p><h4>Method 1: Select All Military Buildings of Specific type</h4><p>As the title suggests, we will use &ldquo;Game Commands&rdquo;&nbsp; to only select specific or all military buildings (without switching camera view). Eventually we&rsquo;ll end up pressing two or 3 button:</p><ul>
<li>First button (for example) selects all archery ranges available (e.g. <kbd>D</kbd> =&gt; Archery Range(s)).</li>
<li>Second button queues a specific unit (e.g. <kbd>G</kbd> =&gt; Archer)</li>
</ul><div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-2" width="480" height="422" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4?_=2"></source><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4</a></video></div><p>You can configure a hotkey to &ldquo;select all&rdquo; Stable, Town Centers, Siege workshop, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Method 2: Filtering Military Buildings</h4><p>This method has a decent potential if you have different types of military buildings and wish to filter through them. How to proceed?</p><ul>
<li>Press <kbd>5</kbd> to select all military buildings or configure it to something.</li>
<li>Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and mouse left click on any military building icon to select only that specific type of building.</li>
<li>Queue army.</li>
</ul><div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-3" width="480" height="388" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4?_=3"></source><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4</a></video></div><h2>Hotkeying Techs &amp; Hotkeys</h2><p>Unlike the previous versions of Age of empires 2.. AoE2 DE lets you assign hotkeys to any building that offer technologies or upgrades to research.</p><p>By the default no hotkeys are assigned to upgrades and techs so to configure them go to Options &gt; Hotkeys ; Then to your left hand side you should click a town center, lumbercamp, etc. to assign any hotkeys to the technologies/upgrades</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1100" src="" alt="hotkeying technologies upgrades" width="597" height="360" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-531x320.jpg 531w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-768x463.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades.jpg 1443w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-1024x617.jpg"></a></p><h2>Typing Practice</h2><p>it is crucial in any RTS game to have a decent typing speed to manage hotkeys and multi-task faster and while some of you may think they are fast typers ..</p><p>Trust me there is one way to find out <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastfingers.com</a> .Usually a fast typer has an average of <strong>60 WPM</strong> (words per minute), less than that you my friend are not a fast typer yet. Check out the video i posted at the beginning of this guide (skip to 8:57) where I took the typing test.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>For beginners, practicing hotkeys in the editor mode is certainly the fastest and best way to memorize them. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of wasting time because the reward is worthwhile.</p></p>

Attack upgrades for archery units also provide an additional range giving these units an offensive opportunity from further distances.</p></blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Cavalry Unit</strong></span> are favored with a priority to Armor Upgrades e.g. Scale Barding, Chain Barding and Plate Barding (<img src="" alt="scale barding armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_scale-barding-armor.jpg"><img src="" alt="chain barding armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_chain-barding-armor.jpg"><img src="" alt="plate barding armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_plate-barding-armor.jpg">) are more important than any Attack upgrades.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Why?</strong> Cavalry units tank a lot of damage from arrows thus it makes more sense to upgrade armors first so they tank even more damage.</p></blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Infantry Unit</span></strong> are favored with a priority to Armor Upgrades e.g. Scale Mail, Chain Mail, and Plate Mail (<img src="" alt="scale mail amor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_scale-mail-amor.jpg"><img src="" alt="chain mail armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_chain-mail-armor.jpg"><img src="" alt="plate mail armor" width="36" height="36" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_plate-mail-armor.jpg">) are more crucial than any attack upgrades.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Why?</strong> Infantry units are initially weaker against archers and upgraded cavalry that is why upgrading armors should increase their resistance therefore more damage is dealt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you asked yourself &ndash; Why am I so bad at this game? &ndash; What to do to beat this guy? &ndash;What am I doing wrong?<p>Today, you will assimilate expertise and answers to all those questions and more in top 5 reasons why you keep losing games in Age of empires 2. Who knows&hellip; This is probably what you needed all along to improve at this game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>1- Less Villagers &amp; Bad Economy Management</h2><div id="attachment_813" style="width: 494px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-813" class="size-full wp-image-813" src="" alt="Constantly create villagers at your town center" width="484" height="443" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/towncenter_villagers.jpg 484w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/towncenter_villagers-350x320.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/towncenter_villagers.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-813" class="wp-caption-text">Constantly create villagers at your town center</p></div><p>There is no doubt that villagers decide the faith of your game. Beginners usually fail to keep the town center constantly queuing villagers and especially early Dark Age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In Dark Age</strong> you have to prioritize the gathering of food resources (<strong><span style="color: #339966;">Sheep, boars, forage bush and deers if possible</span></strong>), then wood comes second. However, Stone and Gold are optionally mined at the last second before clicking up to Feudal Age.</p><div id="attachment_819" style="width: 467px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-819" class="size-full wp-image-819" src="" alt="Important Feudal age economy upgrades" width="457" height="139" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Feudal-age-upgrades.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-819" class="wp-caption-text">Important Feudal age economy upgrades</p></div><p>As soon as you reach <strong>Feudal Age</strong>, you are expected to research the economic upgrades (<strong><span style="color: #339966;">Double-Bit Axe, Horse Collar and Wheelbarrow</span></strong>) -unless you are doing a fast castle build order- while prioritizing once again the creation of villagers at your town center.</p><p>Age of Empire 2 is a slow paced game, thus the failure to make villagers constantly is going to put you in a horrible position later on that game.</p><p>When you click up to Castle Age you need to ensure that you have all the economic upgrades in addition to the <strong><span style="color: #339966;">gold upgrade</span></strong> and at least <strong><span style="color: #339966;">13 Lumberjacks</span></strong>. This latter is important because you need extra 2 town centers upon reaching Castle Age.</p><div id="attachment_820" style="width: 467px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-820" class="size-full wp-image-820" src="" alt="Important Castle Age economy upgrades" width="457" height="139" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Castle-age-upgrades.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-820" class="wp-caption-text">Important Castle Age economy upgrades</p></div><p><strong>At Castle Age</strong>, <strong><span style="color: #339966;">Bowsaw upgrade</span></strong> is a must research economic upgrade because Wood is the hero of this age. You will need to make military units, <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>build a minimum of 2 extra town centers</strong></span>, seed more farms and construct more military buildings all in that particular order.</p><p>Post-Castle Age or around 30&rsquo;ish mins game time, specifically <strong><span style="color: #339966;">30 mins sharp you should have 27 or 30 farmers at least</span></strong>. Pulling this number of farmers at 30 mins is a good sign of paving your way to prowess at this game. Moreover, 30 farmers are needed to click up to the Imperial Age.</p><p><strong>Just clicked up to Imperial Age?</strong> Starting from Dark Age to Post-Imperial, <strong><span style="color: #339966;">DO NOT stop making villagers</span></strong>. That&rsquo;s where most players take the fall; it&rsquo;s at late Imperial Age. They found themselves with lesser villager count compared to the enemy, as a result, the economy rapidly deteriorates with barely any resources to spare for trash army.</p><h2>2- Hotkeys</h2><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-815 size-full" src="" alt="Setting up hotkeys for Age of Empires 2" width="547" height="350" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotkeys_setup_aoe2-1.jpg 547w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotkeys_setup_aoe2-1-500x320.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotkeys_setup_aoe2-1.jpg"></p><p>Multiplayer will certainly punish you for not using hotkeys. I wish I knew about hotkeys back when I discovered Multiplayer. It felt like all the players were cheating and building things way too fast, so one day I had to ask one of these players how do you build and attack faster? The answer was: Do you use hotkeys?</p><p>As simple as that, you should use hotkeys for everything while the mouse is only used for camera movement and unit assignment.</p><p>Your first time to give hotkeys a go? I recommend hotkey profiles from pro players because they are customized not to exhaust your hand muscles.</p><p>Interested in trying them out? Check out this post: <a title="How to Install Hotkey Profiles from Pro Players" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/how-to-install-hotkey-profiles-from-pro-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Install Hotkey Profiles from Pro Players</a></p><p>You can still customize the hotkeys to fit your needs by accessing Options &gt;Hotkeys</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3- Practice Sheet</h2><p>Nobody was born a pro gamer out of playing casually and randomly. Whoever is a pro today must have been playing the game smarter than you do.</p><p>It all comes up to capturing the tiniest deal of details from your gameplay. Details that have remained oblivion to you since a very long time. But as of today, I&rsquo;m honored to unveil the secret behind playing smarter.</p><p>Taa Daa&hellip;</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816" src="" alt="AoC Practice Sheet By GregStein" width="1225" height="457" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet.jpg 1225w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet-622x232.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet-768x287.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet-1024x382.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1225px) 100vw, 1225px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet.jpg"></p><p>This is one of the secrets I have been sitting on for a long time. In fact, this excel practice sheet file I am about to share with you right now has helped me make the jump from 1600 Voobly ELO to 1750-1800 Voobly ELO. Another fact, I do not play on a regular basis&hellip;</p><p>Imagine what you could achieve if you are playing Age of Empires II regularly?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a download link to my <a title="AoC Practice Sheet" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_21WgbQD36ejSrr19a1P0XJT7UdDzHeHr5YbWf3T6k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AoC Practice Sheet</a></p><p>Before you give this a go let me explain how it works</p><p>This practice sheet is a three column table in a critical order (Errors, Mistakes, Bad Habits) + a one column Table (Notes)</p><p>An <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Error</strong></span> simply means that something came out wrong with the build order but after watching a pro you finally could see what you were going wrong. Or doing something wrong until someday someone points that out to you.</p><p>A <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mistake</span></strong> is rarely done 3 or 5 games out 10 games due to poor reasoning, carelessness and lack of concentration.</p><p>Bad <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Habits</span></strong> or negative habits are actions you always repeat in your gameplay. Try to replace them by positive habits.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong> are to be used for intelligence gathering from a particular player or wisdom learning.</p><h2>4- Ladder Anxiety &amp; Insufficient Practice</h2><h3>How to defeat Ladder Anxiety?</h3><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-817" src="" alt="ladder anxiety explained" width="408" height="325" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ladder-anxiety-explained.jpg 408w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ladder-anxiety-explained-402x320.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ladder-anxiety-explained.jpg"></p><p>Self-Confidence is the essence of your gameplay. If you fear your opponent and the game has not even started yet, you might as well just resign or play a different game.</p><p>So do not let some random non-perfect human being just like you get to your mind. Play for a learning experience and fun; only later comes a deserved win.</p><p>Do you often hesitate to host a game room or join a 1v1 game? That could be a sign of &ldquo;Ladder Anxiety&rdquo; but you can overcome that in three simple steps.</p><h3>3 Steps To Defeat Ladder Anxiety</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong>&nbsp; Take a deep breath and try to imagine all those glorious and positive moments you had in multiplayer and follow that with a wide smile (make sure nobody is looking at you).</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Forget about the existence of your enemy. Think of him as a computer bot, or a hot woman/man (not judging) that needs to be impressed by you.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Most important step. Do not focus on winning the game but rather focus on improving very little things in your gameplay or what I call them small goals e.g. (In the next game, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>(Small Goal 1)</strong>I want to practice walling starting from 12 population at dark age</span>, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>(Small Goal 2)</strong> I want to have 14 farms at 14 mins</span>)</p><p>The moment you achieve a small goal your brain is going to feel positively encouraged to play and practice more because you have genuinely achieved and improved something out of a loss or a victory &ndash; It&rsquo;s a win-win situation either way.</p><h3>What&rsquo;s the right way to practice a build order?</h3><p>You may often find yourself intimidated and destroyed by some opponents then all you could think about next is to switch strategy instead of learning to adapt to the same strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is why you keep losing over and over because you do not let yourself get accustomed to the mechanics and reactions that every build order requires you to deliver.</p><p>You may ask: what are these mechanics and reactions?</p><p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p><ul>
<li>APM distribution: Some advanced build orders require higher apm to manage both an attack and economy (e.g. Drush + Fast Castle, Men At Arms). Whereas standard build orders (e.g. <a title="A Scout Rush Build Order and Secrets In a step by step" href="https://ageofnotes.com/strategies/scout-rush-build-order-secrets-step-step/">Scout rush</a>, 23 archers require lesser apm because the first 12 minutes of the game are more economically focused.)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Reactions:</strong></p><ul>
<li>You are expected to react multiple times during the game-play after scouting your opponent (e.g. The enemy is spotted mining stone earlier dark age: Reaction =&gt; Anticipate the locations from where the enemy would probably hit you with the tower rush then prepare a defense such as &ldquo;2 or 3 militias + scout + 2 villagers&rdquo; or &ldquo;5 villagers only&rdquo; to deal with that.) For a more detailed post to dealing with such aggression, I recommend this read: <a title="How To Counter A Tower Rush &ldquo;Trush&rdquo;" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/counter-tower-rush-trush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How To Counter A Tower Rush &ldquo;Trush&rdquo;</a></li>
</ul><blockquote><p>The pinpoint here is to stick with one strategy and divide your build order into pieces of &lsquo;small goals&rsquo; then practice piece by piece until perfection &ndash; Instead of wasting your time learning the entire build order at once.</p></blockquote><h2>5- Bad Internet</h2><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818" src="" alt="Bad internet and lag issues" width="420" height="316" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amount_lag_high.jpg"></p><p>I am pretty sure that most of you are familiar with desyncs, lag and connection drops. Those are gameplay learning killers.</p><p>I drew a table to help you better understand who is responsible for these issues; how to address them and fix them.</p><table width="0">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Multitasking in RTS games &ndash; Be it Age of Empires 2 or&nbsp;Starcraft 2 &ndash; is very critical; especially in competitive 1vs1 matchups. In this post, I am going to grab your hand and walk you through from the very little secret&hellip;&nbsp; To the most important techniques and practices to improve your multitasking.<p><strong>First of all, What&rsquo;s Multitasking?</strong></p><p>Multitasking is the ability to perform more than one task or activity over a short period of time. For example &ndash; When you start a new game in Age of Empires 2, You usually get 3 villagers and a scout.</p><p>So a player with decent multitasking skills would use 2 villagers to build a house somewhere nearby the town center. The other villager will also build a house in a different position. Also, move his scout cavalry to look for his 4 starting sheep and explore the map for other resources. ALL THESE tasks in 15 seconds &lsquo;Age of Empires time&rsquo;, which is 9 seconds real world time.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-221 " src="" alt="Age of empires 2 how to multitask" width="710" height="415" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/multitasking-aoe2.jpg 973w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/multitasking-aoe2-546x320.jpg 546w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/multitasking-aoe2-768x450.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/multitasking-aoe2.jpg"></p><p>If you are a beginner, It is really NOT as easy as it sounds. It&rsquo;ll take you some practice to&nbsp;eventually get used to it. Anyhow, that was just an example of a&nbsp;multitude of other tasks.</p><p>Now Let&rsquo;s get started&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Get a Gamer Mouse</span></h2><p><img class="wp-image-207 aligncenter" src="" alt="Gaming Mice" width="451" height="254" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-mice.jpg 912w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-mice-300x169.jpg 300w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-mice-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-mice.jpg"></p><p>Many gamers today use standard mice and keyboards purchased at a bargain price ($2 &ndash; $5). Which is fine especially for someone who just wants to chill out with friends and play less stressful games.</p><p>A budget as low as $5 for a mouse and a keyboard is very reasonable. However, players &ndash; with a genuine desire to learn Age of Empires 2 or RTS games in general &ndash; are required to spend more cash on their gaming equipment.</p><p>Thank god It&rsquo;s 2017! a decent brand-new gaming mouse is going to cost you between ($20 &ndash; $200). Of course I myself will not pay $200 for a gaming mouse yet. After all, most reliable and picked up mice among Expert players are those within the range of ($40 &ndash; $99). I obtained mine at $69, 5 years ago and It still works like charm.</p><p>Now, what should you be looking for into a mouse so that It is doubtlessly a gaming mouse?</p><ul>
<li>Extra buttons</li>
<li>Software/Drivers for the mouse (CD-ROM)</li>
<li>USB Wired Mouse (Avoid Wireless)</li>
<li>Mouse size should fit your hand</li>
<li>Minimum of 500 Hz Polling rate</li>
<li>Minimum of 4000 DPI</li>
<li>Disassemblable</li>
</ul><p>I will quickly&nbsp;go into the points listed above so to comprehend further their utility:</p><h3>Why Extra Buttons?</h3><p><img class="wp-image-208 aligncenter" src="" alt="Mouse extra buttons macros" width="443" height="249" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-extra-buttons-rts.jpg 800w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-extra-buttons-rts-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-extra-buttons-rts-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-extra-buttons-rts.jpg"></p><p>It allows you to setup Advanced Macro commands on the fly. For example, You can make any extra button do&nbsp;<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>&nbsp;Which basically means: If you click that extra button once, It will automatically go to your archery range building and queue one archer. Useful, huh? And here where it gets even more interesting&hellip;</p><p>When you click and hold the extra button, It will cycle between all your archery range buildings and queue one archer in parallel with each building.</p><h3>Why Mouse Software?</h3><p>Simply a gaming mouse without a software is no gaming mouse! The software grants you access to edit Advanced Macros, DPI Level, polling rate and set up separate profiles for various games.</p><h3>Why USB Wired Mouse/Polling Rate?</h3><p>Briefly, a Wireless mouse polling is LESS reliable and inconsistent than a USB Wired mouse. Polling rate essentially ensures that your mouse moves smoothly, accurately and without freezing.</p><p>The Minumum required value of polling rate is 500Hz OR a recommended value would be 1000 Hz.</p><p>Another lousy downside of a Wireless mouse is, suddenly in the middle of a game it may shut down due to low battery/power cells or Bluetooth stops working. So be warned!</p><h3>Why DPI?</h3><p>Standard mice come with 800 DPI or a maximum of 1400 DPI, which is not enough for improving your speed of control in Age of Empires 2.</p><p>A recommended value for RTS games would be between 2000 &ndash; 4000 DPI.</p><p>If you have never possessed a gaming mouse, you might find &ldquo;2000 DPI&rdquo; very overwhelming. Don&rsquo;t worry! It is perfectly normal.</p><p>I still remember the first time I bought my Mad Catz RAT 5 mouse. I initially set it to 2200 DPI then I could hardly control it in-game. But after a week of continuous practice and games, It has become very natural and my gameplay mechanics felt superior to beforehand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Disassemblable?</h3><p><img class="wp-image-209 aligncenter" src="" alt="disassembly mice" width="305" height="253" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disassembly-mouse-e1511209721360.jpg 658w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disassembly-mouse-e1511209721360-386x320.jpg 386w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disassembly-mouse-e1511209721360-75x63.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disassembly-mouse-e1511209721360.jpg"></p><p>This is one of the most disregarded features that gamers should pay more attention to. An easily disassemblable mouse makes life so much easier when &ndash; for example, you have a double click issue or a malfunctioning mouse wheel &ndash; Very common issues that usually occurs after 2 years of excessive gaming. Now instead of buying a new mouse, You can simply youtube any of those issues and fix it within 15 mins. You can also look up videos on how to disassemble and assemble gaming mice.</p><p>The pinpoint here is, mouse disassembly saves you cash $$$</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Get Gamer Keyboard (Optional)</h3><div id="attachment_212" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-image-212 " src="" alt="gamer keyboard with extra buttons" width="483" height="250" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-keyboard-extra-buttons.jpg 996w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-keyboard-extra-buttons-618x320.jpg 618w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-keyboard-extra-buttons-768x398.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-keyboard-extra-buttons.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Gamer keyboard with extra buttons (Madcatz RAT Cyborg)</p></div><p>Gamer keyboards can also help improve your gameplay and reaction time. However, Not as much important as a mouse.</p><p>Some of the fancy advantages that a gaming keyboard can represent to you are:</p><ul>
<li>(Optional)&nbsp;<strong>Extra buttons:</strong>&nbsp;More Advanced macro commands.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical keys:</strong>&nbsp;A keyboard built with high quality, typically spring activated, key switches. These key switches vary based on the keyboard&rsquo;s application or user preference. &hellip; Mechanical keyboards simply feel better than rubber dome keyboards.</li>
<li><strong>Lightening Modes: </strong>Such as night mode lights. It makes your keyboard keys viewable in dark rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Media buttons:&nbsp;</strong>Play, Stop, Pause, Next, previous Music through your keyboard without having to alt-tab out.</li>
<li><strong>Extra USB/Audio plug ports:&nbsp;</strong>You can finally use your short cable headphones without a need to an extension. Also, make use of an extra USB port.</li>
</ul><h3>Windows Mouse Settings For Gamers</h3><p>As I promised throughout this guide. You are walking out from this with so many multitasking tips.</p><p>In this step, I will teach you how to adjust your mouse settings on Windows 7, 8 or 10.</p><p>Before we get into the settings, You must know that Windows and since the release of Windows XP. It has implemented &ldquo;Pointer Precision&rdquo; which basically lets windows system anticipate the mouse movements of users and essentially the cursor is going to anticipate and land on a button or close a window in an accurate way.</p><p>Well, this practice is horrible in the sense that you no longer&nbsp;have a 100% control of your mouse. That is why Expert players &ndash; whether RTS, FPS or MMO &ndash; turn off Pointer Precision to gain a complete control of the mouse.</p><h3>How to Turn off&nbsp;Enhance pointer precision?</h3><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-213 aligncenter" src="" alt="How to Turn off&nbsp;Enhance pointer precision?" width="346" height="332" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-settings-rts.jpg 584w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-settings-rts-333x320.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-settings-rts.jpg"></p><p>To turn off pointer precision, simply click windows&nbsp;startup button &gt; search for &ldquo;mouse&rdquo; &gt; In Mouse Properties Window &gt; Click &ldquo;Pointer Options&rdquo; Tab &gt; Untick Enhance pointer precision and make sure that pointer speed is at Level 6/11 as demonstrated in the image below.</p><h3>The MarkC&nbsp;Mouse Acceleration Fix</h3><p>MarkC is a registry file that &ndash; when applied to your computer &ndash; removes Windows 7 or 8 or 8.1 or 10 mouse pointer acceleration.</p><p>You can download this fix from the official creator:&nbsp;<a href="https://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/03/markc-windows-7-mouse-acceleration-fix.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MarkC Mouse fix by Mark Cranness</a></p><div id="attachment_135" style="width: 514px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135" class="wp-image-135 " src="" alt="MarkC Mouse Acceleration FIx for Age of Empires 2" width="504" height="110" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/markc-mouse-fix-age-of-empires-2.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-135" class="wp-caption-text">Use the mirror link in case of a download error</p></div><p>Once you download the archive and open it. Look for The MarkC MouseFix builder and then extract its content somewhere on your desktop or documents.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-136 aligncenter" src="" alt="" width="277" height="186" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/markc-mouse-fix-builder.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After you extract those contents. Just run &ldquo;MarkC_Windows_10+8.x+7+Vista+XP_MouseFix_Builder.CMD&rdquo; and then a small window will pop up. Then just keep clicking &ldquo;OK&rdquo;&hellip; At the end of the process&hellip; Another small window will turn up &ldquo;Browse For Folder&rdquo; (as shown in the image below).</p><p>For example, select desktop and click OK to save your &ldquo;Registry File&rdquo; &ndash; which we are going to install after this step.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-137 aligncenter" src="" alt="" width="242" height="275" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/markc-end-of-install.jpg"></p><p>Finally, Go to Desktop or that location where you saved the registry file. Then simply double-click it and confirm it as shown below:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-138 aligncenter" src="" alt="" width="383" height="142" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/registry-confirm-markc.jpg"></p><p>Congratulation! Just restart your computer and your mouse should be ready to function as accurate as never before.</p><p>
[alert-success]Be aware that all of these changes we have applied, your mouse (may) feel weird or be troublesome to control.</p><p>It is perfectly normal! All of us has gone through this! And if you would like to be a good player.</p><p>Be patient for at least a few days or one week&nbsp;tops. Because then your mouse control will improve significantly. [/alert-success]
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Build Muscle Memory In Age of Empires 2</h2><p>This is the most crucial part of this tutorial&hellip;</p><p>I assume now that you have acquired the previous section. Now we advance to a very important element in improving your multitasking skills.</p><p>It is &ldquo;Building Muscle Memory&rdquo;.</p><h3>What&rsquo;s Muscle Memory?</h3><p><del>It is definitely not memory stored in your muscles.</del> It is a set of repetitive and frequent tasks that your muscles perform and that are cached and saved in your brain. e.g. If you play Tennis and practice, for instance, the &ldquo;Backspin&rdquo; as demonstrated in the picture below:</p><p><img class="size-medium wp-image-147 aligncenter" src="" alt='Tennis "Backspin"' width="300" height="180" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/backspin_muscle_memory-300x180.jpg"></p><p>The first time you try to Backspin, you are likely to fail (the execution). However, after lots of practice: The movement of your body; The position of your legs; The strength of your serving; The manner of holding the racket&hellip;&nbsp;All these acts are going to be saved in your brain. And every time you practice a Backspin; Your brain calls those acts and then everytime You do a Backspin, It is done: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Faster</strong></span>(<span style="color: #008000;">less time</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Efficient</strong></span>(<span style="color: #008000;">precision</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Impulsive</strong></span>(<span style="color: #008000;">without thinking</span>).</p><p>Did you get it? Muscle Memory is essentially everything Multitasking is. Since both, they relate to each other in terms of <strong>(Faster, Efficient, Impulsive).</strong></p><p>Now let&rsquo;s go back to Age of Empires 2&hellip;</p><h3>What Are Specific Exercises To Improve Muscle Memory(Multitasking) in Age of Empires?</h3><p>Age of Empires 2 makes use of both your hands&rsquo; muscles. So clearly, we are going to practice Both Hands exercises and Single Handed exercises.</p><p><strong>Hotkeys Exercise (Single Handed Focused)</strong></p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-214 size-large aligncenter" title="Age of empires 2 hotkeys" src="" alt="Age of empires 2 hotkeys" width="620" height="349" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2.jpg 1919w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2-1024x576.jpg"></a></p><p>Age of Empires 2 as an RTS genre can NOT be without hotkeys. Even (FPS) aiming games like counter striker or battlefield rely on hotkeys.</p><p>The use of hotkeys optimizes so many seconds of your gameplay and not to mention efficiency gained over the practice.</p><p>First off, if you are a beginner to Age of Empires 2? Or you haven&rsquo;t learned hotkeys yet. You must jump into the map editor, set all resources to 999999 and practice all hotkeys. An accepted example of practicing hotkeys: Build a house 10 &ndash; 15 times using (B + E or whatever hotkey it is set to).</p><p>Remember: Faster, Efficient, Impulsive!</p><p>The more you practice a single hotkey, you will do it precisely and efficiently in less time. I understand that this practice will take you about 30 &ndash; 45 mins. Once you are done with it, you can only practice it again the next day. Until you feel that you are performing them&nbsp;Faster, Efficient, Impulsive. Usually, In 2 &ndash; 3 days of practice is enough.</p><p>If you are of 2000 or&nbsp;above <strong>Steam ELO</strong>. This exercise is probably pointless for you because you already have a good grasp of your hotkeys. However, If you are struggling with a single hotkey, You should think of changing it immediately and practice it for 3 mins in the map editor.</p><p><strong>Typing Test Exercise&nbsp;(Both Hands Focused)</strong></p><p>RTS relies heavily on hotkeys; Thus typing. So if you are not a fast typer then this exercise is a must do.</p><p>Some of you might think they are fast typers. When in fact, you should take a typing test to find out&hellip;</p><p>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">10fastfingers.com</a></p><p>If you achieve&nbsp;60 wpm then you are indeed a fast typer. Above 60 wpm You are a god. However, lower than 60wpm around 50 ish is fine. 40 ish or bellow &hellip; You need help!!LOL. Just kidding!! Go practice and you will get better.</p><p><strong>Multitask and Reaction Dedicated Games (Both Hands Focused)</strong></p><p>I can&rsquo;t stress enough how important this exercise can be!! Especially for players who are new to Age of Empires 2 or any RTS. Also very useful if you recently bought a mouse or keyboard.</p><p>Here is your gold&hellip; OSU!&nbsp;<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://osu.ppy.sh/</a></p><p>Just sign up an account on OSU! and download the game. Now go to <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist&amp;s=4&amp;r=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Beatmap Listing</a> and download any song from there or use the search field to find your favorites.</p><p>Launching OSU! Run the game tutorial to understand basics ( You will use your hand to move the cursor + Keyboard keys to click the circles). There are levels and It gets more difficult at hardest, Insane or Above.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t need to master all the levels. Just acquiring&nbsp;85% at hard or hardest is all that it takes to get a better control.</p><p><strong>Improve your Mouse control (Single Handed Focused)</strong></p><p>Another crucial exercise for players that do a lot of misclicks&hellip; Is <a href="https://aim400kg.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aim400Kg</a></p><p>Just practice it 2 or 3 times a day to get the hang with your mouse control.</p><p><strong>Play Other RTS Games (Both Hands Focused)</strong></p><p>Let me tell you a little story how I managed to make a jump from 155+ Voobly ELO to 17++. I have always been a huge fan of Age of Empires 2. And I would argue with other fellow friends from Starcraft 2. To try to demonstrate that AOE2 requires higher skills and multitasking. Four different resources to manage instead of two in sc2 etc.</p><p>The saddest part is &hellip; I was only 155+ Voobly Rate.. 11</p><p>In the same year,&nbsp; my cousin, who lives in France, only started playing Starcraft 2 for like a year. Then he started an argument with me that If Age of Empires 2 is that good then I should beat him in Starcraft 2&hellip;</p><p>I accepted his challenge and downloaded <a href="https://us.battle.net/account/download/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Starcraft 2 client (Battle.net)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Signed up an account then bought and&nbsp;<a href="https://us.battle.net/account/download/?show=sc2&amp;starter=sc2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">downloaded Starcraft 2</a>&nbsp;<strong>(Now It is for free to download)</strong></p><p>I asked him to give me 2 days to beat him. Two days later we played and I got crushed so hard for 5 games in the row&hellip; I was&nbsp;veeeeeryyy mad that day! He beat me and trashed talking too&hellip;</p><p>I was tilted to a point that I started digging video tutorials on youtube and looking for build orders&hellip; Guess What I have figured out? Starcraft 2 is just as strategic as Age of Empires 2 and shares the same aspects as well. You can do rush builds, economic builds, cheese builds, all-in builds. The game also relies on&nbsp;Hotkeys, macro, and micro etc.</p><p>I sighed in relief seeing that&hellip; Because deep inside I knew that I am very familiar with all those technicalities. And have higher chances to learn within few days.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what happened exactly! Just a week later, my cousin logged in and saw that I was Top 15 Gold Rank already (slightly higher level than his). He was shocked and didn&rsquo;t believe that. Until we played 3 games where I humiliated him repeatedly with a roach and hydra rush.</p><p>One month later, I was first in the Platinum Rank.&nbsp;Four Months later, I was Diamond Rank Top 50. A few Months later, I got the Masters Rank Tier 3.</p><p>And <strong>It was then when&nbsp;game after another I started climbing the 17++ ELO in Voobly and even beat 18++ players sometimes.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Lesson here is playing other RTS games can also participate in getting better at age of empires 2.</strong></span></p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0608818284340124" data-ad-slot="4690050753" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins><script>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a Beginner or a New player to Age of Empires 2. Then this is the right place for you.<p>This guide has a crucial priority over other articles and tutorials. Make sure you read every section and piece of information in this guide.</p><h2>Ingame Settings For Age of Empires 2</h2><p>You just can not ignore this section. As these settings are going to help you so much indeed!!</p><h3>Time</h3><p>The first thing you should do is to <strong>Enable Time</strong>&nbsp;Ingame using your keyboard key&nbsp;<kbd>F11</kbd>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Time should display at the top left corner of your screen.</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-165 aligncenter" src="" alt="how to enable time age of empires 2" width="236" height="126" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/enable-time-age-of-empires-2.jpg"></p><p>Time will help you keep track of your build order. In terms of How long does it take you to click Feudal Age, Castle Age or Imperial Age; When to build an army; When to do upgrades. Another crucial utility for Time is &ndash; It helps out with timing attack strategies such as: a Drush or a Fast Castle.</p><h3>Advanced Commands</h3><p>After enabling time, You also need to Enable Advanced Commands. To do that, Click the Gear button in the bottom right corner of the Mini-Map.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-164 aligncenter" src="" alt="enable advanced commands age of empires 2" width="280" height="140" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/advanced-commands.jpg"></p><p>Advanced commands essentially grant you access to:</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-166 aligncenter" src="" alt="explaining advanced commands age of empires 2" width="349" height="156" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/explaining-advanced-commands-age-of-empires-2.jpg"></p><p><strong>Army Commands:</strong> Patrol, Guard, Follow, Kill Unit, Garrison.</p><p><strong>Army Formations</strong>: Aggressive Stance, Defensive Stance, Stand Ground, No Attack Stance.</p><h3>Statistics</h3><p>There is also <strong>Statistics</strong> feature which must be Enabled as well. Click the Blue Flags button on the top right corner of the Mini-Map.</p><p><img class="wp-image-163 aligncenter" src="" alt="enable statistics in age of empires 2c" width="278" height="176" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/enable-statistics.jpg"></p><p>Statistics is a very big deal. Expert players rely on it a lot to &lsquo;anticipate&rsquo; what the enemy is up to. A good example would be in the Dark Age. When It is 07:45 mins or 08:00 mins (Ingame) and your enemy&rsquo;s score is 650 while yours is 830. That usually means in a pro matchup that your enemy is luring deer instead of scouting you.</p><p>The score can also reveal if your ally or enemy is behind or ahead of you. And whoever has the highest score is usually doing something right or just better.</p><h3>Extended Help</h3><p>Finally, Turn On <strong>Extended&nbsp;Help</strong>&nbsp;feature using your keyboard key&nbsp;<kbd>F1</kbd>. You may need to click a couple of times to make sure It says Extended: On/On</p><p><img class="wp-image-162 aligncenter" src="" alt="extended help age of empires 2" width="303" height="196" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/extended-help.jpg"></p><p>Thanks for Extended Help! You get to see on-screen actions that are occurring somewhere else. For example, You are busy building some farms and distributing villagers then suddenly a warning sound followed by two sentences on-screen that says:</p><p><strong>Warning! You are being attacked by wolves.</strong></p><p><strong>Warning! You are being attacked by an Enemy.</strong></p><p>The point here is you <span style="color: #ff0000;">may not hear the warning sound play twice</span>. But those written warnings will be there.</p><p>Now you are all set to practice build orders or play a multiplayer game.</p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0608818284340124" data-ad-slot="4690050753" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins><script>
