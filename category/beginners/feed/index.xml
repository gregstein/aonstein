<p align="left">Darko Dautovic, One of the oldest legends of Age of empires 2 and a meme for his failure &amp; bad luck in building castles to 100%. Nonetheless he&#8217;s 35 years old and currently ranks 30th and won 59 tournaments including a recent <a href="https://liquipedia.net/ageofempires/Red_Bull_Wololo/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RedBull 3</a> tournament; Daut&#8217;s macro remains one of the best you can learn from.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Since 2002</strong></p>
<p align="left">Daut started playing with a couple of friends in LAN. Then a friend from high school informed him about MSNZONE where AoE2 was played competitively.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/msnzone-ageofempires2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1194 " title="msn zone client for age of empires 2 back in 2000" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/msnzone-ageofempires2-1024x768.jpg" alt="msn zone client for age of empires 2 back in 2000" width="583" height="437" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/msnzone-ageofempires2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/msnzone-ageofempires2-427x320.jpg 427w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/msnzone-ageofempires2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/msnzone-ageofempires2.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /></a></p>
<p align="left">That’s when Dautovic started committing to play but surprisingly confessed his regret to this decision back in 2010 when he was <a href="https://www.aoezone.net/threads/interview-with-serbia-_daut_-darko-dautovic.30857/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed by Mr Asphalt</a>. However given his achievements these last years &#8211; I doubt he regrets anything today?</p>
<p align="left">Daut has set off his commitment to streaming since February 2017 playing almost every day. During that period (2017-2021), he won 38 tournaments most of them were team games.</p>

<h2>1.Use Hotkeys</h2>
<p>If you want to get better at this game, hotkeys are the primary priority to consider. What are hotkeys? It is basically using your keyboard to build and play the game (not just the mouse). You can access and edit your hotkeys by running the game, click the gear button top right hand side</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1155" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/options-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive.jpg" alt="options for age of empires 2 definitive" width="422" height="259" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/options-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive.jpg 630w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/options-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-521x320.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>
<p>Then click Option and Hotkeys. From there you can view what each hotkey does and why not edit some of them to suit you.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1154" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021-1024x706.jpg" alt="hotkeys for age of empires 2 DE" width="620" height="427" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021-1024x706.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021-464x320.jpg 464w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021-768x530.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hotkeys-aoe2de-2021.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><br />
After checking out and editing your hotkeys, you should now start practicing them in &#8220;Editors&#8221;, create a new scenario and generate a random map and set all resources to 9999.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1156" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/map-editor-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition.jpg" alt="map editor age of empires 2 definitive edition" width="474" height="264" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/map-editor-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition.jpg 941w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/map-editor-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-574x320.jpg 574w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/map-editor-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></p>
<p>Then build economical/military structures one by one until you memorize them, It should take you a few minutes or less depending if you are a fast learner.</p>
<h2>Practice One Easy Build Order</h2>
<p>&#8220;The most complicated skill is to be simple.&#8221; &#8211; Learning intermediate or advanced build orders will certainly hinder your learning. it&#8217;s like a 7 year old asking to skip school and high school straight up to college. If you want to get better at any RTS game and faster.. You ought to start step by step and learn the easiest build chunk by chunk.</p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/archers.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1170" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/archers.jpg" alt="23 archers build order blueprint" width="359" height="636" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/archers.jpg 480w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/archers-181x320.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></a></p>
<p>Easy build orders such as <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/strategies/23-pop-archers-build-order-step-by-step-to-destroy-ranked-queue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 Archers</a> or the Fast Castle Knight Rush should teach you the basics of running a good economy. The funny part is that the <span style="color: #008000;">dark age economy is 99% similar to any intermediate or advanced build</span>. So rest assured an easy build order will pave road for any build order out there. But most importantly force you to focus on your economy and that&#8217;s the whole point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep practicing the same build order over and over (losing or winning doesn&#8217;t matter) &#8211; What matters is tracking and improving your feudal/castle age times. Yes! It may be boring at first but later&#8230; Trust me the outcome is yourself better than most players in your league.</p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Huns, Britons &amp; Persians are beginner friendly civilizations and best for practice.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px">
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Huns do not need houses saving lots of wood for military production and farms. Besides never getting pop capped.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Britons consume sheep faster leaving your town center in constant villager production. It&#8217;s the best civ for 23 archers build order since archers are trained 20% faster.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Persians set off with extra resources allowing constant villager production and a better dark age economy. Also access to almost the entirety of tech tree.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</div></div>
<p>It&#8217;s up to you now &#8211; Do you want to master AoE2 the fast and right way or just try out random builds and slowly improve?</p>
<h3>Follow-up yourself and ensure mastering the build order</h3>
<p>First and foremost how do you know you really learnt that easy build order? Each build order has markers or timestamps that confirm whether you mastered the build order or not. Here is a list of markers to check against your build orders:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking Feudal Age with <strong>22 population at 8:07</strong> (Max benchmark). Or 23 population at 8:35 mins (Max benchmark).</li>
<li>Have you researched economic upgrades as soon as you hit Feudal age?</li>
<li>Do you have <strong>12 to 14 farms before 15 mins</strong> (depending on build order)?</li>
<li>Have you researched <strong>wheelbarrow at 16 mins</strong> to go up Castle faster. Or <strong>18 mins to go up late</strong> with an economic advantage. Or <strong>no wheelbarrow</strong> with a vulnerable economy?</li>
<li>Have you clicked <strong>Castle Age at 22 mins (max) or earlier</strong>?</li>
</ol>
<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>You are ready to practice and learn intermediate and advance builders. Only this time you will find them more practical and easier than before.</p>
<p>I recommend Two Build orders:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CQGYJuVPVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Militias Drush</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/strategies/scout-rush-build-order-secrets-step-step/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scout Rush</a></li>

<h2>Use Visual Mods</h2>
<p>Visual mods might seem like a stupid tip to new or beginner players &#8211; How could a visual mod help you out? – the answer is: a visual mod improves the gameplay experience.<br />
Let’s a take a look at these extremely useful and must have mods:</p>
<h3>A) Small Trees</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1171" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/small-tree-ageofempires2.gif" alt="Small trees for Age of empires 2 Definitive" width="402" height="302" /></p>
<p>This mod reduces the height of trees as a result you get a clear view of your lumberjacks and easily micro them for a better wood saturation</p>
<p><strong>Why shouldn’t you use the original big trees?</strong></p>
<p>The Original Trees makes it difficult for players to select and micro their lumberjacks behind those big trees. It is also frustrating to build walls using forest patches as you might miss a tile or two.</p>

<h3>B) Advanced Idle Pointer</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1173" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-1024x641.png" alt="advanced idle pointer for age of empires 2 definitive edition" width="620" height="388" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-1024x641.png 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-511x320.png 511w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-768x481.png 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/advanced-idle-pointer-for-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition.png 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Beginner players tend to idle their villagers a lot. It is also the case of average/expert players and that does not mean they are inattentive player. It’s just that sometimes you would be staring at your idles but not notice them because your attention is directed somewhere else.</p>
<p>Hence the idea of this mod is to display an exclamation mark over any idle villager to alert you therefore less idle time and higher chances to win more games than before.</p>

<h3>C) Huge Number</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1174" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number-1024x641.jpg" alt="Huge Number for age of empires 2 definitive edition" width="620" height="388" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number-511x320.jpg 511w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number-768x481.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Huge-Number.jpg 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Huge Number increases the size of control group numbers making them easily visible. So you don’t want to be that guy that boxes his units every game and all day long then eventually his hand ends up unnecessarily exhausted. Notably, the higher your game resolution the smaller the control group numbers so players with glasses or without glasses would squinch their eyes to see those numbers.</p>

<h2>Watch Recorded Games The Proper Way Explained</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1157" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive-1024x661.jpg" alt="watch replays in age of empires 2 definitive" width="620" height="400" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive-1024x661.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive-495x320.jpg 495w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive-768x496.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/watch-replays-in-age-of-empires-2-definitive.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes of watching recorded games is not taking down notes or grasp the reasoning behind a specific transition or unit choice. Sometimes you see a pro do Drush Fast castle but what you do not comprehend is why, when or what?</p>
<p>Throughout my journey of watching hundreds of recorded games I devised a 3-steps-method</p>
<h3>Step 1: Answer WH questions</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m sure most of you are familiar with WH questions. We studied those at school and here we are again employing them in a video game &#8211; Ironic!? I will jump straight to an example and answer these WH questions along the way to give you an idea how to process information from a replay.</p>
<ol>
<li>What map is it? e.g. Arabia</li>
<li>What civilizations are they playing? e.g. Britons Vs Teutons</li>
<li>How is their Maps, Open or Closed? e.g. Britons (Closed Map) Vs Teutons (Open map)</li>
<li>Where the Britons Resource located at? e.g. Main gold is in the back</li>
<li>What’s the Britons Population after clicking Feudal Age?</li>
</ol>
<p>(Feel free to ask more WH questions to deeply analyze any playstyle or opening. However these should be enough)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 2: Extract The Build Order Timeline</h3>
<p>The best way to learn a build order is to take down every little detail to mimic the build order to perfection.<br />
A great and concise way of doing so is to take note of time as well as the task. Sometimes you can use population or any event as a timeline marker.</p>
<p>Take this Drush build as an example: [@ means (at)]
@6:04: Build barracks<br />
@7:05: Start creating Militias<br />
@9:20 – 9:30: Hit enemy base with Militias<br />
@32 Pop: Click Feudal Age (Scout + 3 Militias counted in)<br />
@Clicked Feudal Age Button: Finish walling<br />
@Feudal Age: Build Archery range &amp; Blacksmith</p>
<p>@14:00: 12 built farms.<br />
@15:00: Research Fletching<br />
etc.<br />
(Feel free to use the same structure or invent your own way whatever helps you memorize faster. If you are new to the game you may want to add more items such as how many farmers, gold miners, and lumberjacks.)</p>
<h3>Step 3: Conclusion &amp; Practice Time</h3>
<p>This is the most crucial step!! From Step 1 &amp; 2 you must come to a conclusion that the Britons player went for Drush Fast castle because his main gold was in the back and his map was easy to wall.</p>
<p><strong>So should I execute Drush FC in any map generation?</strong> No, you may not (possible in an open map but risky).</p>
<p><strong>What do you learn?</strong> Do NOT come to a conclusion by yourself. Let Step 1 WH questions conclude for you.</p>
<p>Now it’s about time to practice and practice makes perfect. No practice No progress! It does not have to be a ranked game, just a few casual practice games against the AI would do the trick.</p>
<p>What happens if you do not practice? In 1 or 3 weeks you’ll forget everything or a few things from what you watched.</p>

<h2>Play To Learn/Improve Your Game-Play (Not to improve your ELO)</h2>
<p>“I will play ranked to improve my ELO.” – Stop thinking like that!! You will fall in the procrastinating trap as soon as you start losing a few games. Your brain will spread negative thoughts due to losing ELO. Keep your mentality detoxified from negativity to perform better.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on improving your ELO, find your points of weaknesses or mistakes committed in previous games then concentrate 90% of your energy to fix those. At the end of the day even if you lose; your mentality remains intact for you have taken time to fix your gameplay issues.</p>
<h2>Small Goals Trick (To Fight Ladder Anxiety &amp; Be Efficient)</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1152" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ladder-anxiety-explained.fw_.png" alt="" width="408" height="325" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ladder-anxiety-explained.fw_.png 408w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ladder-anxiety-explained.fw_-402x320.png 402w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">Do you feel nervous, shaky or your heart beats faster when jumping in a ranked game or playing against a pro?</span><br />
Do 5, 10 or 20 push-ups to get rid of the shakiness.</p>
<p>It is totally normal for a human being to have feelings of excitement. That only says how much of an emotional human being you are; love and care about the game and its outcome.</p>
<p>Nonetheless.. You must overcome those feeling before the game begins so you can concentrate on the game income not the outcome.</p>
<p>Today, I will share with you the small goals trick to conquer your inner-fear.</p>
<p><strong>First Step..</strong></p>
<p>Rehearse some of these phrases at the start of the game:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a game I don&#8217;t care&#8221;,<br />
&#8220;My enemy is probably shitting his pants more than I do&#8221;,<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s a practice game I don&#8217;t care about end results&#8221;,<br />
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about ELO I want to improve this and that&#8221;.</p>
<p>Your brain cares a lot about the game and take it very seriously. Therefore that brain of yours visualizes and prioritizes the vision of unresolved small negative scenarios rather than fun and small positive scenarios notably due to emotion.</p>
<p>So how can you reverse the order of visions in your brain from small negatives-positive (&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;+) to small positives+negative (+++++++++-)?<br />
Second Step..</p>
<p>You simply need to put small goals in your brain before/during the beginning of the game. Small goals are the small mistakes you did in the previous games. And in the next game try to fix them one after another.</p>
<p><strong>This example will illustrate step 1 &amp; 2:</strong></p>
<p>In the previous game (Mistakes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Your TC had some idle time</li>
<li>You lured the second boar late</li>
<li>You didn’t find all 8 sheep</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next game (Fix Mistakes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your TC is making villagers</li>
<li>Lure the second boar earlier</li>
<li>Find all your 8 sheep</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixing those small goals (mistakes) ==&gt; For every and any small mistake you fix you are building up a positive momentum in your brain which boosts and inflates positive signs over negative signs. End results: Your brain visualizes Positives over negatives (+++++++++++-) &lt;== positives is ruling over negatives and self-confidence is boosted.</p>

<p>Sometimes you start losing focus or throw games easily so that&#8217;s usually a sign of boredom or exhaustion. It would be best stop grinding age of empires all day  and take a break. Play other RTS games for a change.</p>
<p>Games that <strong>truly</strong> resemble Age of empires 2 &amp; I personally enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><a href="https://starcraft2.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starcraft 2</a> (5 Stars)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I promise you that you will experience new mechanics and ironically get better at Age of empires 2. These games are not only fun and extremely similar to AoE2 but also will increase your reaction time and attention to little details.</p>
<p>From my personal experience, and back in Voobly days I used to be 14+ but then after taking a break I started playing SC2, EE2 and Caesar3 then a month later I was the first among my friends to make it to 16+ then later 18+.</p>
<h2>Stay Hydrated &amp; Foods</h2>
<h3>Water: Does Dehydration impact your gaming performance?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1176" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/brain-is-75-percent-water.jpg" alt="brain is 75 percent water" width="467" height="311" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/brain-is-75-percent-water.jpg 900w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/brain-is-75-percent-water-480x320.jpg 480w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/brain-is-75-percent-water-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>Did you know your brain is about 75% water?[1] And when It’s functioning on a full reserve of water you will  be more focused, think faster and experience greater clarity and creativity, additionally the removal of toxins from your brain and supplying essential nutrients work at higher rate.<br />
A fully hydrated brain exchanges nutrients and toxins faster ensuring better concentration and mental awareness.</p>
<p><strong>How much should you drink?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1187" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sipping-water-while-gaming.jpg" alt="sipping water while gaming" width="438" height="271" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sipping-water-while-gaming.jpg 640w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sipping-water-while-gaming-517x320.jpg 517w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /></p>
<p>There is no way to know how much an individual should drink, but having a bottle nearby to take sips of fresh water constantly is the smartest thing to do.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Nutrients in food are not only essential to survival and health but also a metric to excel in your daily activities. Both physical and mental activities are involved when you are gaming. These types of foods are recommended to boost gaming activity:</p>
<p><strong>Omega-3 Rich Foods</strong> (Mental Boosters)</p>

<li>Lentils</li>
<li>Any Omega-3 Rich Fish</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Have Fun</h2>
<p>I can not emphasize enough the criticality of Fun. Games are supposed to entertain you. So If you take age of empires too seriously you will enter the circle of procrastination. Where you start visualizing yourself winning a game beforehand. And failing to do so may trigger particular behaviors such as anger or boredom. Such behaviors will have a profound impact in your next games.</p>
<p><strong>How to have fun in Age of empires 2 ?</strong></p>
<p>Create some excitements in your life before you play age of empires online. So what cheers you up the most? For me ordering electronics or going out with friends lightens up my mood. Now suddenly winning a game in AoE2 is less important than receiving my order or meeting friends.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to play AoE2 and focus at improving something in your gameplay. I talked about this previously in Tip#6: Small Goals Trick that way even if you lose you main goal was to improve this and that not win the game. And Remember that losing is an opportunity to improve nobody on planet earth is born with a winning syndrome.</p>
<p>Here is a replay proof from <strong><span style="color: #800000;">TheViper back in the days when he was a noob</span></strong> just to prove a point.</p>
<div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="440" height="280" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uWTyLqTil5Y?autohide=0&autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&fs=1&loop=0&modestbranding=0&playlist=&rel=1&showinfo=1&theme=light&wmode=&playsinline=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" title=""></iframe></div>

<h2 class="western">Top Three Situations Where You Should Stay On 1 TC</h2>
<p>(1) You have more or equal army of your opponent</p>
<p><strong>A- e.g.</strong> You got 20+ crossbows: get a university then research ballistics. Image below shows all crucial upgrades you need.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1122 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20-crossbows.jpg" alt="20+ crossbows all in play" width="380" height="350" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20-crossbows.jpg 380w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20-crossbows-347x320.jpg 347w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B-  e.g.</strong> you got 20+ farmers/12+ gold miners to support nonstop Knights (called a mini boom) =&gt; Rather add a forward siege and ram/mango his military structures. Check important upgrades for knights below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1123 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15-knights.jpg" alt="15 knights mini boom" width="380" height="350" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15-knights.jpg 380w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15-knights-347x320.jpg 347w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) When an Enemy has a mass of crossbows or Knights or whatever. Meantime you barely got any army, you must instantly build a siege. Queue <b>2 mangonels</b> to defend against crossbows. Or build a monastery against Knights.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mangonel.png" alt="mangonel png" width="101" height="74" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mangonel.png" alt="mangonel png" width="101" height="74" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/priest-monk-png.png" alt="priest monk png" width="55" height="43" /></p>
<p>Keep the production of whatever military you are building until you have enough only then start thinking about adding tcs (tcs after 24 mins are considered late so watch out for time).</p>
<p>(3) Against an opponent that goes 1 TC all in you can and should do the same until you are sure he is no threat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Top Three Situations Where You Should Build 2 Extra TCs</h2>
<p>(1) You did a drush fc on your opponent and you can afford both army and tcs (add one tc at a time to keep your eco balanced for military as well)</p>
<p>(2) You are <b>attacking him at his base</b> and he&#8217;s busy dealing with you. <b>Take another advantage and tcs boom behind that</b>. (but keep your army alive as long as possible)</p>
<p>(3) You just <b>took an advantage</b> by killing all his army before castle or in early castle so you might as well <b>take another advantage</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Civilizations That Get Away With Extra Town Centers?Why?</h2>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Britons</span></strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Why?</span> 1 TC costs 150 wood &amp; 100 stone.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Celts</span></strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Why?</span> With Their wood gathering bonus, Celts often float extra wood.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Burmese</span></strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Why?</span> The free Wood upgrades let them stockpile wood faster all over the next 3 ages.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Byzantines</span></strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Why?</span> By default one of the best defensive civilization in the game due to access to cheaper defenses and structures get bonus HP every age.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s silly of me to generate such a stupid graph but it&#8217;s always nice to remind your brain how huge is 70%</p>
<p>As usually the guide will be tackled in the very little details. <strong>There is also a video version of this guide..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAFOb-cY9YA?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" title=""></iframe></div>
<h2>Hotkeys Setup</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to the hotkey world, It&#8217;s recommended to use one of the hotkey presets of pro players. For that reason I got you covered with a pack of hotkey files which you can either install them yourself manually or use a little app to accomplish it in glimpse of an eye.</p>
<h3><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Manual Method</span></h3>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">1. Download the hotkey files zip: <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hotkey-Profiles.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotkey-Profiles.zip</a></span></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">2. Press <kbd>Windows Button</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd></span></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">3. Type in: <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>%userprofile%\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">4. A folder should pop up. Now inside it you&#8217;ll find another folder or more with random numbers e.g. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aoe2de-hotkeys-profiles-location.png" alt="aoe2de hotkeys profiles example" width="372" height="206" /></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">5. Enter those folders with the random numbers then inside &#8220;/profile/&#8221; folder extract the hotkey files zip inside them both &#8220;76561198079200175&#8221; &amp; &#8220;76561198286982586&#8221;, but if you only have one folder it&#8217;s ok. It should look like this</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1085" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aoe2-hotkeys-hki-files.png" alt="aoe2 hki files" width="372" height="244" /></p>
<h3>Automatic Method</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re feeling lazy to manually install the hotkey pack, you can download this little tool from here:</p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HotkeyPack-DE.zip">HotkeyPack DE Tool To Install Pro Hotkeys</a></p>
<p>Inside the Archive there a &#8220;<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>HotkeyPack-DE.exe</strong></span>&#8221; file, just double click it ( no need to extract it) Then a window like this one appears:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1087" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hotkeypack-de-tool.jpg" alt="" width="393" height="257" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hotkeypack-de-tool.jpg 689w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hotkeypack-de-tool-489x320.jpg 489w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" /></p>
<p>Press the install button and that&#8217;s it. We have all these hotkey presets installed automatically.</p>

<h2>Units &amp; Objects</h2>
<p>in Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition or any previous version, we can set hotkeys to <span style="color: #339966;">4 sets of units &amp; objects</span>:</p>
<p><strong>1- Military Units</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1089 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits.jpg" alt="military units assign hotkeys" width="347" height="200" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits.jpg 703w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/militaryunits-555x320.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2- Buildings</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1090 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-1024x495.jpg" alt="buildings hotkey bindings" width="351" height="170" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-1024x495.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-622x301.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings-768x371.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/buildings.jpg 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3- Workers</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1091 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2.jpg" alt="" width="352" height="168" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2.jpg 818w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2-622x297.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/workers-aoe2-768x367.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4- Animals</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1092 alignleft" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals.jpg" alt="animals hotkey binding" width="346" height="209" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals.jpg 536w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/animals-531x320.jpg 531w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">How To Set a Hotkey on Unit(s) Object(s)?</span></h3>
<p>Use your mouse to box whatever object(s) or unit(s) you wish to hotkey then for example: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd> 1 </kbd>(select any number from 0 &#8211; 9)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1093" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1.jpg" alt="hotkeying units with ctrl + 1" width="426" height="301" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1.jpg 598w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/army-ctrl-1-452x320.jpg 452w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p>Now that our army above is set to number 1. There are two ways to employ this hotkey.</p>
<h4>Single Click On Keyboard Key <kbd> 1 </kbd></h4>
<p>Only selects your units without switching camera view.</p>
<h4>Double Click on Keyboard Key <kbd> 1</kbd></h4>
<p>Selects your units and switches the camera view at their location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> When taking fights away from town, you can use single click (number 4 for example) to select the town center and queue villagers without having to switch the camera view. Or pull your army away using the single click.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Camera &amp; Location Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Although Age of Empires 2 do not have dedicated camera hotkeys as those in Starcraft 2&#8230; Fortunately for us we do have cycle commands that essentially work like the camera hotkeys for example</p>
<div id="attachment_1094" style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1094" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1094" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys.jpg" alt="camera hotkeys for age of empires 2 definitive" width="635" height="410" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys.jpg 939w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys-496x320.jpg 496w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/camerahotkeys-768x496.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1094" class="wp-caption-text">Cycle Commands work like camera hotkeys.</p></div>
<p>As long as you build a lumbercamp, mill, mining camp, or barracks. You can use go to hotkeys to switch to view to those structures.</p>
<p>Switch camera to:</p>
<p>Lumberjacks =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> (Replicate hotkey to switch to another lumbercamp location)</p>
<p>Foragers/Farmers =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> (Replicate hotkey to switch to another mill location)</p>
<p>Gold/Stone Miners =&gt; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> (Replicate hotkeys to switch to another mining camp location)</p>
<p>ETC. (Same thing applies to barracks, archery range, university, castles, etc.)</p>
<div class="su-service"><div class="su-service-title" style="padding-left:42px;min-height:28px;line-height:28px"><i class="sui sui-tipeee" style="font-size:28px;color:#e44144"></i> Abuse location hotkeys instead of moving your mouse around to save time and unnecessary moves. And keep your hand muscles more energized for important micro tasks.</div><div class="su-service-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="padding-left:42px"></div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tips For Queuing Units Faster</h2>
<h3>Shift Hotkeys</h3>
<p>Shift hotkeys are a brand-new and exclusive mechanic for the definitive edition of Age of Empires 2. A basic usage of shift hotkeying is to assign any unit to a sequential of actions or tasks.</p>
<p>For example if you can command a villager to do 4 actions by himself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a house.</li>
<li>Consume a Forage Bush.</li>
<li>Gather Fish</li>
<li>Mine gold</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-1" width="480" height="268" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shifthotkeys.mp4</a></video></div>
<ol>
<li>Select a Villager.</li>
<li>Build a house Then Hold <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key</li>
<li>Mouse Right Click on : a forage bush, fish patch, and finally gold patch.</li>
<li>Take your finger off <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key</li>
</ol>
<h3>Queuing Units Faster</h3>
<p>Queuing military units with hotkeys makes a colossal difference in the battle and between two beginner players.  Today I will teach two methods to queue your army then choose whatever you goes with your taste.</p>
<p>You must first configure Select All hotkeys to suit your needs by entering Options &gt; Hotkeys &gt; Game Commands. Then scroll down to find them</p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1099" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-1024x626.jpg" alt="select all hotkeys for age of empires 2 definitive edition" width="492" height="301" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-523x320.jpg 523w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys-768x470.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/select-all-hotkeys.jpg 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></a></p>
<h4>Method 1: Select All Military Buildings of Specific type</h4>
<p>As the title suggests, we will use &#8220;Game Commands&#8221;  to only select specific or all military buildings (without switching camera view). Eventually we&#8217;ll end up pressing two or 3 button:</p>
<ul>
<li>First button (for example) selects all archery ranges available (e.g. <kbd>D</kbd> =&gt; Archery Range(s)).</li>
<li>Second button queues a specific unit (e.g. <kbd>G</kbd> =&gt; Archer)</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-2" width="480" height="422" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aoe2-selectmilitary.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>You can configure a hotkey to &#8220;select all&#8221; Stable, Town Centers, Siege workshop, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Method 2: Filtering Military Buildings</h4>
<p>This method has a decent potential if you have different types of military buildings and wish to filter through them. How to proceed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <kbd>5</kbd> to select all military buildings or configure it to something.</li>
<li>Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and mouse left click on any military building icon to select only that specific type of building.</li>
<li>Queue army.</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-1083-3" width="480" height="388" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4">https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grouphotkeys.mp4</a></video></div>
<h2>Hotkeying Techs &amp; Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Unlike the previous versions of Age of empires 2.. AoE2 DE lets you assign hotkeys to any building that offer technologies or upgrades to research.</p>
<p>By the default no hotkeys are assigned to upgrades and techs so to configure them go to Options &gt; Hotkeys ; Then to your left hand side you should click a town center, lumbercamp, etc. to assign any hotkeys to the technologies/upgrades</p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1100" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-1024x617.jpg" alt="hotkeying technologies upgrades" width="597" height="360" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-531x320.jpg 531w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades-768x463.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hotkeying-technologies-upgrades.jpg 1443w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></a></p>
<h2>Typing Practice</h2>
<p>it is crucial in any RTS game to have a decent typing speed to manage hotkeys and multi-task faster and while some of you may think they are fast typers ..</p>

</script>
<p>Trust me there is one way to find out <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastfingers.com</a> .Usually a fast typer has an average of <strong>60 WPM</strong> (words per minute), less than that you my friend are not a fast typer yet. Check out the video i posted at the beginning of this guide (skip to 8:57) where I took the typing test.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For beginners, practicing hotkeys in the editor mode is certainly the fastest and best way to memorize them. Don&#8217;t be afraid of wasting time because the reward is worthwhile.</p>

<p>Tip: Fletching, Bodkin Arrow, and Bracer also provide additional range for units and buildings.</p>
<h2>What Blacksmith Upgrades Should you Research First?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Archery Unit</strong></span> are favored with a priority to Attack Upgrades e.g Fletching, Bodkin and Bracer (<img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_fletching.jpg" alt="fletching" width="36" height="36" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_bodkin-arrow.jpg" alt="bodkin arrow" width="36" height="36" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_bracer.jpg" alt="bracer" width="36" height="36" />) are more important than any Armor upgrades.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Why?</strong> Non-upgraded Archery units initially have less attack and are usually created in large numbers thus attack upgrades will double their damage input however armor upgrades have secondary priority. Attack upgrades for archery units also provide an additional range giving these units an offensive opportunity from further distances.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Cavalry Unit</strong></span> are favored with a priority to Armor Upgrades e.g. Scale Barding, Chain Barding and Plate Barding (<img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_scale-barding-armor.jpg" alt="scale barding armor" width="36" height="36" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_chain-barding-armor.jpg" alt="chain barding armor" width="36" height="36" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_plate-barding-armor.jpg" alt="plate barding armor" width="36" height="36" />) are more important than any Attack upgrades.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Why?</strong> Cavalry units tank a lot of damage from arrows thus it makes more sense to upgrade armors first so they tank even more damage.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Infantry Unit</span></strong> are favored with a priority to Armor Upgrades e.g. Scale Mail, Chain Mail, and Plate Mail (<img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_scale-mail-amor.jpg" alt="scale mail amor" width="36" height="36" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_chain-mail-armor.jpg" alt="chain mail armor" width="36" height="36" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_plate-mail-armor.jpg" alt="plate mail armor" width="36" height="36" />) are more crucial than any attack upgrades.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Why?</strong> Infantry units are initially weaker against archers and upgraded cavalry that is why upgrading armors should increase their resistance therefore more damage is dealt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now these are all the upgrades available at the blacksmith for every Age</p>
<h2>Feudal Age Blacksmith Upgrades</h2>

<p>I have purposefully added military buildings next to every upgrade because an upgrade affects units of an entire building or two buildings the case of &#8220;Forging&#8221;.</p>

<p>Once you research feudal age upgrades, new upgrades will be unlocked in the same spot making it easier for you to keep upgrading the same unit.</p>
<p>Let me walk you into it again</p>

<p>Excellent! So far we have learnt that blacksmith upgrades affect 3 basic buildings: Archery Range, Barracks, and Stable.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s move on and have a quick look at blacksmith upgrades for UU (Unique Units).</p>
<h2>Blacksmith Upgrades For Unique Units</h2>
<p>To make it easy for you to quickly memorize upgrades for each Unique Unit, I will add upgrade icons near every UU.</p>
<p>But before I do that you must know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any Unique Unit that fires <strong>arrows</strong> or <strong>long spears</strong> is considered as an <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Archery Unit </span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">and</span> affected by <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_fletching.jpg" alt="fletching" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_padded-archer-armor.jpg" alt="padded archer armor" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_bodkin-arrow.jpg" alt="bodkin arrow" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_leather-archer-armor.jpg" alt="leather archer armor" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_bracer.jpg" alt="bracer" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_ring-archer-armor.jpg" alt="ring archer armor" width="36" height="36" /></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Mangudai, Rattan Archer, Camel Archer, Elephant Archer,etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any Unique Unit that carries a sword or spear is considered as an <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Infantry Unit</span></strong> and affected by <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_scale-mail-amor.jpg" alt="scale mail amor" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/forging.jpg" alt="forging" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_chain-mail-armor.jpg" alt="chain mail armor" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_iron-casting.jpg" alt="iron casting" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_plate-mail-armor.jpg" alt="plate mail armor" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_blast-furnace.jpg" alt="blast furnace" width="36" height="36" /></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Samurai, Karambit Warrior, Jaguar Warrior, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any Cavalry Mounted Unique Unit that fights with a sword or robe is considered as a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Cavalry Unit</strong></span> affected by <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_scale-barding-armor.jpg" alt="scale barding armor" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/forging.jpg" alt="forging" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_chain-barding-armor.jpg" alt="chain barding armor" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_iron-casting.jpg" alt="iron casting" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_plate-barding-armor.jpg" alt="plate barding armor" width="36" height="36" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_blast-furnace.jpg" alt="blast furnace" width="36" height="36" /></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Tarkan, Cataphract, Boyar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">Exceptional Unique Units</span></h3>
<p>There are some tricky Unique Units that can deceive you into thinking they are archers but in fact they are Infantry or Cavalry units, thus require different upgrades. Let take a look at all those exceptional unique units.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/arambai.jpg" alt="arambai" width="36" height="36" /> <strong>Arambai</strong> is a <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dart Thrower Unit </span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">and affected by <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_padded-archer-armor.jpg" alt="padded archer armor" width="36" height="36" /> + <img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_bloodlines.jpg" alt="bloodlines" width="36" height="36" />(Burmese do not have access to the rest of archer armor upgrades)</span></p>

<h2>Are Blacksmith Upgrades Good Enough?</h2>
<p>At Feudal Age, the Blacksmith upgrades are only good enough for infantry and Archery Units. Cavalry Units on the other hand are better off with <span id="su_tooltip_60d296f0a1675_button" class="su-tooltip-button su-tooltip-button-outline-yes" aria-describedby="su_tooltip_60d296f0a1675" data-settings='{"position":"top","behavior":"hover","hideDelay":0}' tabindex="0">Bloodlines</span><span style="display:none" id="su_tooltip_60d296f0a1675" class="su-tooltip" role="tooltip"><span class="su-tooltip-inner su-tooltip-shadow-yes" style="background:#222222;color:#FFFFFF;font-size:16px;border-radius:5px;text-align:left;max-width:300px;line-height:1.25"><span class="su-tooltip-title">Bloodlines</span><span class="su-tooltip-content su-u-trim">+20 Hit Points</span></span><span id="su_tooltip_60d296f0a1675_arrow" class="su-tooltip-arrow" style="background:#222222" data-popper-arrow></span></span> (<img loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tech_bloodlines.jpg" alt="bloodlines" width="36" height="36" />) before considering the blacksmith.</p>
<p>At Castle Age, the Blacksmith upgrades are yet important for infantry and Archery Units. Later on and as far as Archery Units are concerned, It&#8217;s highly recommended to consider the following:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you asked yourself – Why am I so bad at this game? – What to do to beat this guy? –What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Today, you will assimilate expertise and answers to all those questions and more in top 5 reasons why you keep losing games in Age of empires 2. Who knows… This is probably what you needed all along to improve at this game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1- Less Villagers &amp; Bad Economy Management</h2>
<div id="attachment_813" style="width: 494px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-813" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-813" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/towncenter_villagers.jpg" alt="Constantly create villagers at your town center" width="484" height="443" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/towncenter_villagers.jpg 484w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/towncenter_villagers-350x320.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" /><p id="caption-attachment-813" class="wp-caption-text">Constantly create villagers at your town center</p></div>
<p>There is no doubt that villagers decide the faith of your game. Beginners usually fail to keep the town center constantly queuing villagers and especially early Dark Age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In Dark Age</strong> you have to prioritize the gathering of food resources (<strong><span style="color: #339966;">Sheep, boars, forage bush and deers if possible</span></strong>), then wood comes second. However, Stone and Gold are optionally mined at the last second before clicking up to Feudal Age.</p>
<div id="attachment_819" style="width: 467px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-819" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-819" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Feudal-age-upgrades.jpg" alt="Important Feudal age economy upgrades" width="457" height="139" /><p id="caption-attachment-819" class="wp-caption-text">Important Feudal age economy upgrades</p></div>
<p>As soon as you reach <strong>Feudal Age</strong>, you are expected to research the economic upgrades (<strong><span style="color: #339966;">Double-Bit Axe, Horse Collar and Wheelbarrow</span></strong>) -unless you are doing a fast castle build order- while prioritizing once again the creation of villagers at your town center.</p>
<p>Age of Empire 2 is a slow paced game, thus the failure to make villagers constantly is going to put you in a horrible position later on that game.</p>
<p>When you click up to Castle Age you need to ensure that you have all the economic upgrades in addition to the <strong><span style="color: #339966;">gold upgrade</span></strong> and at least <strong><span style="color: #339966;">13 Lumberjacks</span></strong>. This latter is important because you need extra 2 town centers upon reaching Castle Age.</p>
<div id="attachment_820" style="width: 467px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-820" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-820" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Castle-age-upgrades.jpg" alt="Important Castle Age economy upgrades" width="457" height="139" /><p id="caption-attachment-820" class="wp-caption-text">Important Castle Age economy upgrades</p></div>
<p><strong>At Castle Age</strong>, <strong><span style="color: #339966;">Bowsaw upgrade</span></strong> is a must research economic upgrade because Wood is the hero of this age. You will need to make military units, <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>build a minimum of 2 extra town centers</strong></span>, seed more farms and construct more military buildings all in that particular order.</p>
<p>Post-Castle Age or around 30’ish mins game time, specifically <strong><span style="color: #339966;">30 mins sharp you should have 27 or 30 farmers at least</span></strong>. Pulling this number of farmers at 30 mins is a good sign of paving your way to prowess at this game. Moreover, 30 farmers are needed to click up to the Imperial Age.</p>
<p><strong>Just clicked up to Imperial Age?</strong> Starting from Dark Age to Post-Imperial, <strong><span style="color: #339966;">DO NOT stop making villagers</span></strong>. That’s where most players take the fall; it’s at late Imperial Age. They found themselves with lesser villager count compared to the enemy, as a result, the economy rapidly deteriorates with barely any resources to spare for trash army.</p>
<h2>2- Hotkeys</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-815 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotkeys_setup_aoe2-1.jpg" alt="Setting up hotkeys for Age of Empires 2" width="547" height="350" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotkeys_setup_aoe2-1.jpg 547w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hotkeys_setup_aoe2-1-500x320.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /></p>
<p>Multiplayer will certainly punish you for not using hotkeys. I wish I knew about hotkeys back when I discovered Multiplayer. It felt like all the players were cheating and building things way too fast, so one day I had to ask one of these players how do you build and attack faster? The answer was: Do you use hotkeys?</p>
<p>As simple as that, you should use hotkeys for everything while the mouse is only used for camera movement and unit assignment.</p>
<p>Your first time to give hotkeys a go? I recommend hotkey profiles from pro players because they are customized not to exhaust your hand muscles.</p>
<p>Interested in trying them out? Check out this post: <a title="How to Install Hotkey Profiles from Pro Players" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/how-to-install-hotkey-profiles-from-pro-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Install Hotkey Profiles from Pro Players</a></p>
<p>You can still customize the hotkeys to fit your needs by accessing Options &gt;Hotkeys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3- Practice Sheet</h2>
<p>Nobody was born a pro gamer out of playing casually and randomly. Whoever is a pro today must have been playing the game smarter than you do.</p>
<p>It all comes up to capturing the tiniest deal of details from your gameplay. Details that have remained oblivion to you since a very long time. But as of today, I’m honored to unveil the secret behind playing smarter.</p>
<p>Taa Daa&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet.jpg" alt="AoC Practice Sheet By GregStein" width="1225" height="457" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet.jpg 1225w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet-622x232.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet-768x287.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet-1024x382.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1225px) 100vw, 1225px" /></p>
<p>This is one of the secrets I have been sitting on for a long time. In fact, this excel practice sheet file I am about to share with you right now has helped me make the jump from 1600 Voobly ELO to 1750-1800 Voobly ELO. Another fact, I do not play on a regular basis…</p>
<p>Imagine what you could achieve if you are playing Age of Empires II regularly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a download link to my <a title="AoC Practice Sheet" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_21WgbQD36ejSrr19a1P0XJT7UdDzHeHr5YbWf3T6k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AoC Practice Sheet</a></p>
<p>Before you give this a go let me explain how it works</p>
<p>This practice sheet is a three column table in a critical order (Errors, Mistakes, Bad Habits) + a one column Table (Notes)</p>
<p>An <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Error</strong></span> simply means that something came out wrong with the build order but after watching a pro you finally could see what you were going wrong. Or doing something wrong until someday someone points that out to you.</p>
<p>A <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mistake</span></strong> is rarely done 3 or 5 games out 10 games due to poor reasoning, carelessness and lack of concentration.</p>
<p>Bad <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Habits</span></strong> or negative habits are actions you always repeat in your gameplay. Try to replace them by positive habits.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong> are to be used for intelligence gathering from a particular player or wisdom learning.</p>
<h2>4- Ladder Anxiety &amp; Insufficient Practice</h2>
<h3>How to defeat Ladder Anxiety?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-817" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ladder-anxiety-explained.jpg" alt="ladder anxiety explained" width="408" height="325" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ladder-anxiety-explained.jpg 408w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ladder-anxiety-explained-402x320.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>
<p>Self-Confidence is the essence of your gameplay. If you fear your opponent and the game has not even started yet, you might as well just resign or play a different game.</p>
<p>So do not let some random non-perfect human being just like you get to your mind. Play for a learning experience and fun; only later comes a deserved win.</p>
<p>Do you often hesitate to host a game room or join a 1v1 game? That could be a sign of “Ladder Anxiety” but you can overcome that in three simple steps.</p>
<h3>3 Steps To Defeat Ladder Anxiety</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>  Take a deep breath and try to imagine all those glorious and positive moments you had in multiplayer and follow that with a wide smile (make sure nobody is looking at you).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Forget about the existence of your enemy. Think of him as a computer bot, or a hot woman/man (not judging) that needs to be impressed by you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Most important step. Do not focus on winning the game but rather focus on improving very little things in your gameplay or what I call them small goals e.g. (In the next game, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>(Small Goal 1)</strong>I want to practice walling starting from 12 population at dark age</span>, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>(Small Goal 2)</strong> I want to have 14 farms at 14 mins</span>)</p>
<p>The moment you achieve a small goal your brain is going to feel positively encouraged to play and practice more because you have genuinely achieved and improved something out of a loss or a victory – It’s a win-win situation either way.</p>
<h3>What’s the right way to practice a build order?</h3>
<p>You may often find yourself intimidated and destroyed by some opponents then all you could think about next is to switch strategy instead of learning to adapt to the same strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why you keep losing over and over because you do not let yourself get accustomed to the mechanics and reactions that every build order requires you to deliver.</p>
<p>You may ask: what are these mechanics and reactions?</p>
<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>APM distribution: Some advanced build orders require higher apm to manage both an attack and economy (e.g. Drush + Fast Castle, Men At Arms). Whereas standard build orders (e.g. <a title="A Scout Rush Build Order and Secrets In a step by step" href="https://ageofnotes.com/strategies/scout-rush-build-order-secrets-step-step/">Scout rush</a>, 23 archers require lesser apm because the first 12 minutes of the game are more economically focused.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reactions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are expected to react multiple times during the game-play after scouting your opponent (e.g. The enemy is spotted mining stone earlier dark age: Reaction =&gt; Anticipate the locations from where the enemy would probably hit you with the tower rush then prepare a defense such as “2 or 3 militias + scout + 2 villagers” or “5 villagers only” to deal with that.) For a more detailed post to dealing with such aggression, I recommend this read: <a title="How To Counter A Tower Rush “Trush”" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/counter-tower-rush-trush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How To Counter A Tower Rush “Trush”</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The pinpoint here is to stick with one strategy and divide your build order into pieces of ‘small goals’ then practice piece by piece until perfection – Instead of wasting your time learning the entire build order at once.</p></blockquote>
<h2>5- Bad Internet</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amount_lag_high.jpg" alt="Bad internet and lag issues" width="420" height="316" /></p>
<p>I am pretty sure that most of you are familiar with desyncs, lag and connection drops. Those are gameplay learning killers.</p>
<p>I drew a table to help you better understand who is responsible for these issues; how to address them and fix them.</p>
<table width="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="170">Who’s Responsible?</td>
<td width="123">Desyncs</td>
<td width="139">Lag</td>
<td width="164">Connection Drops</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="170">Steam</td>
<td width="123">Desyncs are Very Common because there is no anti-cheat system.</td>
<td width="139">Computer Lag: the game is severely slow and stuffers on most computers.</p>
<p>Multiplayer Lag: 250 ping is considered a “yellow” ping  and may introduce a bad multiplayer experience</td>
<td width="164">Once disconnected and reconnected from internet Steam is may or may not drop you from the game 50%-50% chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="170">Voobly</td>
<td width="123">Desyncs are do not Exist! Thanks to a powerful Voobly anti-cheat system</td>
<td width="139">Computer Lag: Do not exist! Thanks to UserPatch.</p>
<p>Multiplayer Lag: 450 ping is considered a “yellow&#8221; ping and only may introduce lag in team games however in 1v1 450 ping is not that bad.</td>
<td width="164">Once disconnected and reconnected from internet Voobly is going to drop you from the game and crash too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="170">Yourself</td>
<td width="123">Cheats, corrupt maps and different game files from other players trigger desyncs.</td>
<td width="139">Computer Lag: Only low rig computer users should avoid running CPU hog programs such as Chrome, Photoshop or using internet security protection while playing the game. Also, gameplay performance on Voobly takes minimum resources compared to Steam.</p>
<p>Multiplayer Lag: Whether you play on steam or Voobly you must access your router and do port forwarding (See info below)</td>
<td width="164">You can avoid internet drops by plugging in an Ethernet cable directly to your pc instead of using Wifi. Also, aggressive Antivirus protection, Windows Updates or Firewall programs may drop you from the internet for no reason.</td>
</tr>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Age of Empires 2 scouting tips to learn the way the pros do. Scout and find all resources (8 sheep, 2boars) under 2 mins.</p>
<p>At the start of every game, you usually get <strong>3 villagers</strong> and <strong>a scout </strong>Except (Mayans <strong>4</strong> villagers, Chinese <strong>6</strong> villagers)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-274 size-full aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/scouting-scene-1-e1511374283169.jpg" alt="new game age of empires 2" width="620" height="425" /></p>
<p>In this example, I am playing as Mongols. By the way, the exclamation mark on each villager means they are idle. (this is <a href="http://www.voobly.com/gamemods/mod/739/Advanced-Idle-Pointer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Advanced Idle Pointer mod by Deadpool</a> for AoC2 OR <a title="Advanced Idle Pointer" href="https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/2589" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced Idle Pointer Mod</a> for AoE2 DE). It helps a lot in finding idle villagers)</p>
<p>Next step would be building a house using <strong>that one villager</strong> nearby sheep (which is west). And those two villagers should build a house north. While the scout should go East. So <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>West</strong>, <strong>North</strong>, <strong>East</strong></span></p>
<p>The (West, North, East) may change depending on where the villagers and the scout are located!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-275 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/scout-scene-2-2-1024x524.jpg" alt="scout efficiently in age of empires 2" width="620" height="317" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/scout-scene-2-2-1024x524.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/scout-scene-2-2-768x393.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/scout-scene-2-2.jpg 1558w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>(<span style="color: #008000;">And please note that sometimes you may not find your sheep straight-up as in this tutorial. So try to move your scout or a villager towards the south to find your 4 starting sheep</span>)</p>
<p>The imagery above demonstrate <strong>where</strong> you should be moving sheep and scout. Now, once the houses are built.  Send the villagers back to the TC (town center) to eat some lamp.</p>
<div id="attachment_276" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-276" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-276 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/scout-scene-3.jpg" alt="age of empires 2 scouting tips" width="350" height="172" /><p id="caption-attachment-276" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;scouting path&#8221; of the scout</p></div>
<p>Looking at the minimap. That <span style="color: #ff0000;">red circular arrow <span style="color: #000000;">is the path your scout should follow.</span></span></p>
<p>Then later on&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_277" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-277" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-277 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/scout-scene-4.jpg" alt="Finish the circular scouting" width="348" height="174" /><p id="caption-attachment-277" class="wp-caption-text">Finish the circular scouting</p></div>
<p>At this point, you should have found 8 sheep, 2 boars, and gold/stone piles.</p>
<p>If you are still missing sheep. Just do another round-about like this</p>
<div id="attachment_278" style="width: 366px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-278" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-278" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/scout-scene-5.jpg" alt="Scout from left to right" width="356" height="179" /><p id="caption-attachment-278" class="wp-caption-text">Scout from left to right</p></div>
<p>Congratulation! Now just practice it a little bit. And remember sometimes your scout may spawn West. So at that point do it vise-versa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Multitasking in RTS games &#8211; Be it Age of Empires 2 or Starcraft 2 &#8211; is very critical; especially in competitive 1vs1 matchups. In this post, I am going to grab your hand and walk you through from the very little secret&#8230;  To the most important techniques and practices to improve your multitasking.</p>
<p><strong>First of all, What&#8217;s Multitasking?</strong></p>
<p>Multitasking is the ability to perform more than one task or activity over a short period of time. For example &#8211; When you start a new game in Age of Empires 2, You usually get 3 villagers and a scout.</p>
<p>So a player with decent multitasking skills would use 2 villagers to build a house somewhere nearby the town center. The other villager will also build a house in a different position. Also, move his scout cavalry to look for his 4 starting sheep and explore the map for other resources. ALL THESE tasks in 15 seconds &#8216;Age of Empires time&#8217;, which is 9 seconds real world time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-221 " src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/multitasking-aoe2.jpg" alt="Age of empires 2 how to multitask" width="710" height="415" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/multitasking-aoe2.jpg 973w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/multitasking-aoe2-546x320.jpg 546w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/multitasking-aoe2-768x450.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p>If you are a beginner, It is really NOT as easy as it sounds. It&#8217;ll take you some practice to eventually get used to it. Anyhow, that was just an example of a multitude of other tasks.</p>
<p>Now Let&#8217;s get started&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Get a Gamer Mouse</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-mice.jpg" alt="Gaming Mice" width="451" height="254" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-mice.jpg 912w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-mice-300x169.jpg 300w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-mice-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></p>
<p>Many gamers today use standard mice and keyboards purchased at a bargain price ($2 &#8211; $5). Which is fine especially for someone who just wants to chill out with friends and play less stressful games.</p>
<p>A budget as low as $5 for a mouse and a keyboard is very reasonable. However, players &#8211; with a genuine desire to learn Age of Empires 2 or RTS games in general &#8211; are required to spend more cash on their gaming equipment.</p>
<p>Thank god It&#8217;s 2017! a decent brand-new gaming mouse is going to cost you between ($20 &#8211; $200). Of course I myself will not pay $200 for a gaming mouse yet. After all, most reliable and picked up mice among Expert players are those within the range of ($40 &#8211; $99). I obtained mine at $69, 5 years ago and It still works like charm.</p>
<p>Now, what should you be looking for into a mouse so that It is doubtlessly a gaming mouse?</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra buttons</li>
<li>Software/Drivers for the mouse (CD-ROM)</li>
<li>USB Wired Mouse (Avoid Wireless)</li>
<li>Mouse size should fit your hand</li>
<li>Minimum of 500 Hz Polling rate</li>
<li>Minimum of 4000 DPI</li>
<li>Disassemblable</li>
</ul>
<p>I will quickly go into the points listed above so to comprehend further their utility:</p>
<h3>Why Extra Buttons?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-208 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-extra-buttons-rts.jpg" alt="Mouse extra buttons macros" width="443" height="249" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-extra-buttons-rts.jpg 800w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-extra-buttons-rts-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-extra-buttons-rts-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></p>
<p>It allows you to setup Advanced Macro commands on the fly. For example, You can make any extra button do <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> Which basically means: If you click that extra button once, It will automatically go to your archery range building and queue one archer. Useful, huh? And here where it gets even more interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>When you click and hold the extra button, It will cycle between all your archery range buildings and queue one archer in parallel with each building.</p>
<h3>Why Mouse Software?</h3>
<p>Simply a gaming mouse without a software is no gaming mouse! The software grants you access to edit Advanced Macros, DPI Level, polling rate and set up separate profiles for various games.</p>
<h3>Why USB Wired Mouse/Polling Rate?</h3>
<p>Briefly, a Wireless mouse polling is LESS reliable and inconsistent than a USB Wired mouse. Polling rate essentially ensures that your mouse moves smoothly, accurately and without freezing.</p>
<p>The Minumum required value of polling rate is 500Hz OR a recommended value would be 1000 Hz.</p>
<p>Another lousy downside of a Wireless mouse is, suddenly in the middle of a game it may shut down due to low battery/power cells or Bluetooth stops working. So be warned!</p>
<h3>Why DPI?</h3>
<p>Standard mice come with 800 DPI or a maximum of 1400 DPI, which is not enough for improving your speed of control in Age of Empires 2.</p>
<p>A recommended value for RTS games would be between 2000 &#8211; 4000 DPI.</p>
<p>If you have never possessed a gaming mouse, you might find &#8220;2000 DPI&#8221; very overwhelming. Don&#8217;t worry! It is perfectly normal.</p>
<p>I still remember the first time I bought my Mad Catz RAT 5 mouse. I initially set it to 2200 DPI then I could hardly control it in-game. But after a week of continuous practice and games, It has become very natural and my gameplay mechanics felt superior to beforehand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Disassemblable?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-209 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disassembly-mouse-e1511209721360.jpg" alt="disassembly mice" width="305" height="253" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disassembly-mouse-e1511209721360.jpg 658w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disassembly-mouse-e1511209721360-386x320.jpg 386w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/disassembly-mouse-e1511209721360-75x63.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></p>
<p>This is one of the most disregarded features that gamers should pay more attention to. An easily disassemblable mouse makes life so much easier when &#8211; for example, you have a double click issue or a malfunctioning mouse wheel &#8211; Very common issues that usually occurs after 2 years of excessive gaming. Now instead of buying a new mouse, You can simply youtube any of those issues and fix it within 15 mins. You can also look up videos on how to disassemble and assemble gaming mice.</p>
<p>The pinpoint here is, mouse disassembly saves you cash $$$</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Get Gamer Keyboard (Optional)</h3>
<div id="attachment_212" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-212 " src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-keyboard-extra-buttons.jpg" alt="gamer keyboard with extra buttons" width="483" height="250" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-keyboard-extra-buttons.jpg 996w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-keyboard-extra-buttons-618x320.jpg 618w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gamer-keyboard-extra-buttons-768x398.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" /><p id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Gamer keyboard with extra buttons (Madcatz RAT Cyborg)</p></div>
<p>Gamer keyboards can also help improve your gameplay and reaction time. However, Not as much important as a mouse.</p>
<p>Some of the fancy advantages that a gaming keyboard can represent to you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Optional) <strong>Extra buttons:</strong> More Advanced macro commands.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical keys:</strong> A keyboard built with high quality, typically spring activated, key switches. These key switches vary based on the keyboard&#8217;s application or user preference. &#8230; Mechanical keyboards simply feel better than rubber dome keyboards.</li>
<li><strong>Lightening Modes: </strong>Such as night mode lights. It makes your keyboard keys viewable in dark rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Media buttons: </strong>Play, Stop, Pause, Next, previous Music through your keyboard without having to alt-tab out.</li>
<li><strong>Extra USB/Audio plug ports: </strong>You can finally use your short cable headphones without a need to an extension. Also, make use of an extra USB port.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows Mouse Settings For Gamers</h3>
<p>As I promised throughout this guide. You are walking out from this with so many multitasking tips.</p>
<p>In this step, I will teach you how to adjust your mouse settings on Windows 7, 8 or 10.</p>
<p>Before we get into the settings, You must know that Windows and since the release of Windows XP. It has implemented &#8220;Pointer Precision&#8221; which basically lets windows system anticipate the mouse movements of users and essentially the cursor is going to anticipate and land on a button or close a window in an accurate way.</p>
<p>Well, this practice is horrible in the sense that you no longer have a 100% control of your mouse. That is why Expert players &#8211; whether RTS, FPS or MMO &#8211; turn off Pointer Precision to gain a complete control of the mouse.</p>
<h3>How to Turn off Enhance pointer precision?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-213 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-settings-rts.jpg" alt="How to Turn off Enhance pointer precision?" width="346" height="332" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-settings-rts.jpg 584w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mouse-settings-rts-333x320.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /></p>
<p>To turn off pointer precision, simply click windows startup button &gt; search for &#8220;mouse&#8221; &gt; In Mouse Properties Window &gt; Click &#8220;Pointer Options&#8221; Tab &gt; Untick Enhance pointer precision and make sure that pointer speed is at Level 6/11 as demonstrated in the image below.</p>
<h3>The MarkC Mouse Acceleration Fix</h3>
<p>MarkC is a registry file that &#8211; when applied to your computer &#8211; removes Windows 7 or 8 or 8.1 or 10 mouse pointer acceleration.</p>
<p>You can download this fix from the official creator: <a href="https://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/03/markc-windows-7-mouse-acceleration-fix.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MarkC Mouse fix by Mark Cranness</a></p>
<div id="attachment_135" style="width: 514px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-135 " src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/markc-mouse-fix-age-of-empires-2.jpg" alt="MarkC Mouse Acceleration FIx for Age of Empires 2" width="504" height="110" /><p id="caption-attachment-135" class="wp-caption-text">Use the mirror link in case of a download error</p></div>
<p>Once you download the archive and open it. Look for The MarkC MouseFix builder and then extract its content somewhere on your desktop or documents.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-136 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/markc-mouse-fix-builder.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="186" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you extract those contents. Just run &#8220;MarkC_Windows_10+8.x+7+Vista+XP_MouseFix_Builder.CMD&#8221; and then a small window will pop up. Then just keep clicking &#8220;OK&#8221;&#8230; At the end of the process&#8230; Another small window will turn up &#8220;Browse For Folder&#8221; (as shown in the image below).</p>
<p>For example, select desktop and click OK to save your &#8220;Registry File&#8221; &#8211; which we are going to install after this step.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-137 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/markc-end-of-install.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="275" /></p>
<p>Finally, Go to Desktop or that location where you saved the registry file. Then simply double-click it and confirm it as shown below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-138 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/registry-confirm-markc.jpg" alt="" width="383" height="142" /></p>
<p>Congratulation! Just restart your computer and your mouse should be ready to function as accurate as never before.</p>
[alert-success]Be aware that all of these changes we have applied, your mouse (may) feel weird or be troublesome to control.</p>
<p>It is perfectly normal! All of us has gone through this! And if you would like to be a good player.</p>
<p>Be patient for at least a few days or one week tops. Because then your mouse control will improve significantly. [/alert-success]

<h2>Build Muscle Memory In Age of Empires 2</h2>
<p>This is the most crucial part of this tutorial&#8230;</p>
<p>I assume now that you have acquired the previous section. Now we advance to a very important element in improving your multitasking skills.</p>
<p>It is &#8220;Building Muscle Memory&#8221;.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s Muscle Memory?</h3>
<p><del>It is definitely not memory stored in your muscles.</del> It is a set of repetitive and frequent tasks that your muscles perform and that are cached and saved in your brain. e.g. If you play Tennis and practice, for instance, the &#8220;Backspin&#8221; as demonstrated in the picture below:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-147 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/backspin_muscle_memory-300x180.jpg" alt="Tennis &quot;Backspin&quot;" width="300" height="180" /></p>
<p>The first time you try to Backspin, you are likely to fail (the execution). However, after lots of practice: The movement of your body; The position of your legs; The strength of your serving; The manner of holding the racket&#8230; All these acts are going to be saved in your brain. And every time you practice a Backspin; Your brain calls those acts and then everytime You do a Backspin, It is done: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Faster</strong></span>(<span style="color: #008000;">less time</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Efficient</strong></span>(<span style="color: #008000;">precision</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Impulsive</strong></span>(<span style="color: #008000;">without thinking</span>).</p>
<p>Did you get it? Muscle Memory is essentially everything Multitasking is. Since both, they relate to each other in terms of <strong>(Faster, Efficient, Impulsive).</strong></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s go back to Age of Empires 2&#8230;</p>
<h3>What Are Specific Exercises To Improve Muscle Memory(Multitasking) in Age of Empires?</h3>
<p>Age of Empires 2 makes use of both your hands&#8217; muscles. So clearly, we are going to practice Both Hands exercises and Single Handed exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Hotkeys Exercise (Single Handed Focused)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-214 size-large aligncenter" title="Age of empires 2 hotkeys" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Age of empires 2 hotkeys" width="620" height="349" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/construct-buildings-age-of-empires-2.jpg 1919w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>Age of Empires 2 as an RTS genre can NOT be without hotkeys. Even (FPS) aiming games like counter striker or battlefield rely on hotkeys.</p>
<p>The use of hotkeys optimizes so many seconds of your gameplay and not to mention efficiency gained over the practice.</p>
<p>First off, if you are a beginner to Age of Empires 2? Or you haven&#8217;t learned hotkeys yet. You must jump into the map editor, set all resources to 999999 and practice all hotkeys. An accepted example of practicing hotkeys: Build a house 10 &#8211; 15 times using (B + E or whatever hotkey it is set to).</p>
<p>Remember: Faster, Efficient, Impulsive!</p>
<p>The more you practice a single hotkey, you will do it precisely and efficiently in less time. I understand that this practice will take you about 30 &#8211; 45 mins. Once you are done with it, you can only practice it again the next day. Until you feel that you are performing them Faster, Efficient, Impulsive. Usually, In 2 &#8211; 3 days of practice is enough.</p>
<p>If you are of 2000 or above <strong>Steam ELO</strong>. This exercise is probably pointless for you because you already have a good grasp of your hotkeys. However, If you are struggling with a single hotkey, You should think of changing it immediately and practice it for 3 mins in the map editor.</p>
<p><strong>Typing Test Exercise (Both Hands Focused)</strong></p>
<p>RTS relies heavily on hotkeys; Thus typing. So if you are not a fast typer then this exercise is a must do.</p>
<p>Some of you might think they are fast typers. When in fact, you should take a typing test to find out&#8230;</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">10fastfingers.com</a></p>
<p>If you achieve 60 wpm then you are indeed a fast typer. Above 60 wpm You are a god. However, lower than 60wpm around 50 ish is fine. 40 ish or bellow &#8230; You need help!!LOL. Just kidding!! Go practice and you will get better.</p>
<p><strong>Multitask and Reaction Dedicated Games (Both Hands Focused)</strong></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t stress enough how important this exercise can be!! Especially for players who are new to Age of Empires 2 or any RTS. Also very useful if you recently bought a mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>Here is your gold&#8230; OSU! <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://osu.ppy.sh/</a></p>
<p>Just sign up an account on OSU! and download the game. Now go to <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist&amp;s=4&amp;r=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Beatmap Listing</a> and download any song from there or use the search field to find your favorites.</p>
<p>Launching OSU! Run the game tutorial to understand basics ( You will use your hand to move the cursor + Keyboard keys to click the circles). There are levels and It gets more difficult at hardest, Insane or Above.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to master all the levels. Just acquiring 85% at hard or hardest is all that it takes to get a better control.</p>
<p><strong>Improve your Mouse control (Single Handed Focused)</strong></p>
<p>Another crucial exercise for players that do a lot of misclicks&#8230; Is <a href="https://aim400kg.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aim400Kg</a></p>
<p>Just practice it 2 or 3 times a day to get the hang with your mouse control.</p>
<p><strong>Play Other RTS Games (Both Hands Focused)</strong></p>
<p>Let me tell you a little story how I managed to make a jump from 155+ Voobly ELO to 17++. I have always been a huge fan of Age of Empires 2. And I would argue with other fellow friends from Starcraft 2. To try to demonstrate that AOE2 requires higher skills and multitasking. Four different resources to manage instead of two in sc2 etc.</p>
<p>The saddest part is &#8230; I was only 155+ Voobly Rate.. 11</p>
<p>In the same year,  my cousin, who lives in France, only started playing Starcraft 2 for like a year. Then he started an argument with me that If Age of Empires 2 is that good then I should beat him in Starcraft 2&#8230;</p>
<p>I accepted his challenge and downloaded <a href="https://us.battle.net/account/download/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Starcraft 2 client (Battle.net)</a> &#8211; Signed up an account then bought and <a href="https://us.battle.net/account/download/?show=sc2&amp;starter=sc2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">downloaded Starcraft 2</a> <strong>(Now It is for free to download)</strong></p>
<p>I asked him to give me 2 days to beat him. Two days later we played and I got crushed so hard for 5 games in the row&#8230; I was veeeeeryyy mad that day! He beat me and trashed talking too&#8230;</p>
<p>I was tilted to a point that I started digging video tutorials on youtube and looking for build orders&#8230; Guess What I have figured out? Starcraft 2 is just as strategic as Age of Empires 2 and shares the same aspects as well. You can do rush builds, economic builds, cheese builds, all-in builds. The game also relies on Hotkeys, macro, and micro etc.</p>
<p>I sighed in relief seeing that&#8230; Because deep inside I knew that I am very familiar with all those technicalities. And have higher chances to learn within few days.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happened exactly! Just a week later, my cousin logged in and saw that I was Top 15 Gold Rank already (slightly higher level than his). He was shocked and didn&#8217;t believe that. Until we played 3 games where I humiliated him repeatedly with a roach and hydra rush.</p>
<p>One month later, I was first in the Platinum Rank. Four Months later, I was Diamond Rank Top 50. A few Months later, I got the Masters Rank Tier 3.</p>
<p>And <strong>It was then when game after another I started climbing the 17++ ELO in Voobly and even beat 18++ players sometimes. </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Lesson here is playing other RTS games can also participate in getting better at age of empires 2.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a Beginner or a New player to Age of Empires 2. Then this is the right place for you.</p>
<p>This guide has a crucial priority over other articles and tutorials. Make sure you read every section and piece of information in this guide.</p>
<h2>Ingame Settings For Age of Empires 2</h2>
<p>You just can not ignore this section. As these settings are going to help you so much indeed!!</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>The first thing you should do is to <strong>Enable Time</strong> Ingame using your keyboard key <kbd>F11</kbd>.  Then Time should display at the top left corner of your screen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-165 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/enable-time-age-of-empires-2.jpg" alt="how to enable time age of empires 2" width="236" height="126" /></p>
<p>Time will help you keep track of your build order. In terms of How long does it take you to click Feudal Age, Castle Age or Imperial Age; When to build an army; When to do upgrades. Another crucial utility for Time is &#8211; It helps out with timing attack strategies such as: a Drush or a Fast Castle.</p>
<h3>Advanced Commands</h3>
<p>After enabling time, You also need to Enable Advanced Commands. To do that, Click the Gear button in the bottom right corner of the Mini-Map.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-164 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/advanced-commands.jpg" alt="enable advanced commands age of empires 2" width="280" height="140" /></p>
<p>Advanced commands essentially grant you access to:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-166 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/explaining-advanced-commands-age-of-empires-2.jpg" alt="explaining advanced commands age of empires 2" width="349" height="156" /></p>
<p><strong>Army Commands:</strong> Patrol, Guard, Follow, Kill Unit, Garrison.</p>
<p><strong>Army Formations</strong>: Aggressive Stance, Defensive Stance, Stand Ground, No Attack Stance.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>There is also <strong>Statistics</strong> feature which must be Enabled as well. Click the Blue Flags button on the top right corner of the Mini-Map.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-163 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/enable-statistics.jpg" alt="enable statistics in age of empires 2c" width="278" height="176" /></p>
<p>Statistics is a very big deal. Expert players rely on it a lot to &#8216;anticipate&#8217; what the enemy is up to. A good example would be in the Dark Age. When It is 07:45 mins or 08:00 mins (Ingame) and your enemy&#8217;s score is 650 while yours is 830. That usually means in a pro matchup that your enemy is luring deer instead of scouting you.</p>
<p>The score can also reveal if your ally or enemy is behind or ahead of you. And whoever has the highest score is usually doing something right or just better.</p>
<h3>Extended Help</h3>
<p>Finally, Turn On <strong>Extended Help</strong> feature using your keyboard key <kbd>F1</kbd>. You may need to click a couple of times to make sure It says Extended: On/On</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-162 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/extended-help.jpg" alt="extended help age of empires 2" width="303" height="196" /></p>
<p>Thanks for Extended Help! You get to see on-screen actions that are occurring somewhere else. For example, You are busy building some farms and distributing villagers then suddenly a warning sound followed by two sentences on-screen that says:</p>
<p><strong>Warning! You are being attacked by wolves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Warning! You are being attacked by an Enemy.</strong></p>
<p>The point here is you <span style="color: #ff0000;">may not hear the warning sound play twice</span>. But those written warnings will be there.</p>
<p>Now you are all set to practice build orders or play a multiplayer game.</p>
