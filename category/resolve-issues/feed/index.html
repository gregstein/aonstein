But anyhow I installed the game and ran it &ndash; I was so excited to test it out.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1011 size-large" src="" alt="main menu of age of empires 2 definitive" width="620" height="349" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de.jpg 1918w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-1024x576.jpg"></a></p><p>I immediately jumped into the single player to test&hellip;and here we go.. freezing and crashing within 15 mins of the game. Besides I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing that my audio was a bit choppier from moment to another.</p><p>In a nutshell, These are the issues I came across repeatedly:</p><ul>
<li>Game crashed after 5 &ndash; 15 mins</li>
<li>Blackscreen then my audio is not working anymore (had to restart pc to fix)</li>
<li>Choppy sound at random moments and sometimes for the entire gameplay</li>
<li>Random frame drops and freezes</li>
<li>Game takes 2 &ndash; 3 minutes to run</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I tried the benchmark tool and I got an average score of <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>580 &amp; 600ish</strong></span> out of 1000 even after lowering the settings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was very depressed and annoyed by that horrible experience so I started thinking and talking to myself&hellip;</p><p>Me: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t format my computer HDD hard drive since 2012.. My graphics card is GT630M which is a medium requirement and my cpu is 8 cores. So could it be my HDD hard drive?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Switching to SSD Hard drive</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SSD-Vs-HDD.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1007" src="" alt="SSD Vs HDD" width="238" height="348" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SSD-Vs-HDD.jpg 590w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SSD-Vs-HDD-219x320.jpg 219w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SSD-Vs-HDD.jpg"></a></p><p>I went to the hardware store and purchased an SSD hard drive &ldquo;Samsung EVO 860 1 TB&rdquo; (<strong>$200 cost</strong>). I asked the guy there to have it installed in my laptop as well as <strong>renewing my cpu thermal paste ($5 cost me) and dust removal for my cpu ($5).</strong></p><p>After the upgrade the computer turned into a turbo fast machine. I installed AoE2 DE through steam.</p><p>I run the game and the surprise happened..</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The game took <strong>less than 10 seconds to get to the main menu</strong>. I stood up and shoved my fist through the air: &ldquo;F*** yeah!!!!&rdquo;</p><p>I never thought an SSD would bring about so much speed improvement into my average pc. At that very moment I felt hope and then the first thing I was tempted to do is to run the benchmark tool.. Guess the results?</p><p>I got <strong>1100/1000</strong>. Yes It&rsquo;s <strong>1100</strong> out of 1000 no spelling mistakes!! with medium graphics not low profile. Remember in my old HDD I got 580/1000 so that makes for 50% improvement.</p><p>Here is my benchmark score for Team games (I have chrome open which explains why 1059.3 not 1100):</p><p>

</p><h2>Game Crashing and Freezing</h2><p>I may have succeeded in bringing the game performance to a higher level BUT&hellip;. the crashes and freezes were often occurring in mysterious circumstances in which I had to investigate further.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_4]</p><p>These are the remaining issues:</p><ul>
<li>After 30 &ndash; 40 mins: Blackscreen then my audio is not working anymore (had to restart pc to fix)</li>
<li>Choppy sound at random moments and sometimes for the entire gameplay</li>
<li>2 out 15 games I crashed</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Change Power Settings</h3><p>I quickly changed my power plan to High Performance by pressing <kbd>Windows Key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to bring up the &ldquo;RUN&rdquo; command then type in:</p><pre class="de1">powercfg.cpl</pre><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010" src="" alt="high performance power plan for aoe2 de" width="942" height="445" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance.jpg 942w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance-622x294.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance-768x363.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance.jpg"></p><p>Then Select<strong> &ldquo;High Performance Plan&rdquo;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Fix Crashes, Black-Screen &amp; Choppy Audio</h3><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>THIS IS THE BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT SECTION IN THIS GUIDE!</strong></span></p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s 95% likely that the crashes and freezes would be long gone after this section.</strong></p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-1006 aligncenter" src="" alt="Fix for Crashing, Freezing and Blackscreen/Audio issues" width="650" height="387" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-is-not-responding.jpeg 650w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-is-not-responding-537x320.jpeg 537w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-is-not-responding.jpeg"></p><p>It is funny how the crashing, blackscreen and audio were so related and linked with each other. If the game does not crash the sound is gone or the game crashes and the sound is not gone.</p><p>So basically, it does not take a genius to come to that conclusion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Coming to how I fixed all that&hellip;</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_5]</p><p>I used two programs:</p><p><a title="DPC Latency Checker" href="https://www.thesycon.de/eng/latency_check.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DPC Latency Checker</a></p><p><a title="LatencyMon" href="https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6944-latencymon.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LatencyMon</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I closed all applications and every window on my desktop before I ran the tests.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Diagnosing with DPC Latency</h4><p>I ran DPC Latency Checker, pressed start button to check my audio latency for about 2 minutes then I saw</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-989 size-full" src="" alt="DPC Latency Checker diagnosing on windows 10" width="586" height="493" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars.jpg 586w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars-380x320.jpg 380w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars-75x63.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars.jpg"></a></p><p>OMG&hellip;. Do you see those Red bars? Briefly.. they are audio latency spikes that potentially trigger all the three issues together: Blackscreen, Sound not working and crashing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully I have fixed this issue before for a friend that had nearly the same thing in league of legends game.</p><p>So without hesitation I ran my &ldquo;Device Manager&rdquo; by pressing <kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to bring up the &ldquo;RUN&rdquo; command again and typed in:</p><pre class="de1">devmgmt.msc</pre><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_3]</p><p>I disabled the following items:</p><ul>
<li>System devices &gt; [x] High precision event timer (Right Click &gt; Disable)</li>
<li>Bluetooth &gt; [x] Intel&reg; Wireless Bluetooth (Right Click &gt; Disable)</li>
<li>Cameras &gt; [x] Any laptop integrated webcam (Right Click &gt; Disable)</li>
<li>Network adapters &gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">disabled all I&nbsp;adapters I do not use and since I use an external wifi card this is What I ended up doing (read below for a detailed explanation).</span></li>

</p><p>Ndis.sys is 1.9 which is nearly 2 ms seconds and that&rsquo;s an absolute huge delay. It took me nearly an hour to find the culprit. Continue reading&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Uninstalling MalwareBytes</h4><p>This has reduced Ndis.sys from 1.9 ms to 0.9ms so this step is 100% valuable.</p><p>Although Malwarebytes was not running in my machine at all but only installed&hellip; I did a research and a lot of people pointed fingers to uninstalling Malwarebytes and antiviruses.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t use any antiviruses so I uninstalled Malwarebytes completely from my machine anyway. And that my friends immediately showed a -1 ms improvement which is a big deal.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_3]</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t have Malwarebytes I advise you to temporarily uninstall any antivirus such as: AVAST, AVG, MCAFE, BITDEFENDER, etc.</p><p>Only got Windows Defender? In that case you just have to disable it using <a title="Defender control tool" href="https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v1-6/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Defender control tool</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Uninstalling Nvidia 3D Vision &amp; Physics Software</h4><p>Go to the search bar and type in: <strong>Add or remove programs</strong></p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-remove-programs-windows.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-995" src="" alt="add remove programs windows 10" width="509" height="501" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-remove-programs-windows.jpg 693w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-remove-programs-windows-325x320.jpg 325w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-remove-programs-windows.jpg"></a></p><p>Type in there &ldquo;Nvidia&rdquo; as show below</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-996" src="" alt="Uninstalling Nvidia 3D Vision &amp; Physics Software" width="466" height="427" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver.jpg 804w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver-350x320.jpg 350w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver-768x703.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver.jpg"></a></p><p>As you can see in the image I only have &ldquo;Nvidia Graphics Driver&rdquo;. I have already uninstalled &ldquo;Nvidia 3D Vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nvidia Physics Software&rdquo;. The pinpoint here is to only keep &ldquo;Nvidia Graphics Driver&rdquo; installed while uninstalling the rest because you may find others so just uninstall them all. They are only additional/optional components that happen to slow down your GPU.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Test Results for DPC Latency &amp; LatencyMon</strong></span></p><p>After uninstalling Malwarebytes and Nvidia additional components as described above I was impressed with DPC Latency test:</p><p>

</p><p>Then LatencyMon test showed mind-blowing improvement for ndis.sys that dropped from 1.9 ms to 0.2 ms which is a magnificent improvement.</p><p>

Simply because that profile employs less Hz which is an add to your overall system resource consumption.</p><h4>Disable Monitor Audio</h4><p><strong>Your Laptop is connected to a monitor screen?</strong></p><p><img class="wp-image-1020 aligncenter" src="" alt="laptop plugged into monitor" width="342" height="166" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/laptop-connected-plugged-to-monitor.jpg"></p><p>Nvidia users are concerned with this. <strong>Because of &ldquo;Nvidia High Definition Audio&rdquo;</strong>, your graphics card is doing extra work and consuming more graphics memory. Only if your graphics card is medium power you must disable Nvidia High Definition Audio which by itself disables your monitor audio.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1021 size-full" src="" alt="nvidia high definition audio disable it" width="392" height="107" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-high-definition-audio-disable-it-e1580920802557.png"></p><p>Double check the sound settings to make sure your monitor audio is no longer detected. This way your graphics card will spike less (<em>spikes often trigger crashes and BSOD</em>)</p><p><span style="color: #339966;">Reducing your resolution a bit contributes significantly into reducing the resource usage and input lag therefore less occurring spikes.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Bonus Tips</h2><p>While my issues have been fixed without these bonus tips, I feel urged to share them because I use them myself for most of my steam games.</p><h3>Launch Commands</h3><p>I have written a post a few weeks ago about Launch commands in AoE2 DE (<a href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition/#Launch_Commands">https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition/#Launch_Commands</a>) in case you have issues such as horizontal blacklines or sound blaster issues. You&rsquo;ll find there the many commands to put into usage.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/fYSKWOnJ7PQkYZqxep/giphy.gif"><img class="aligncenter" src="" alt="AoE2 DE Commands" width="480" height="327" data-layzr="https://media.giphy.com/media/fYSKWOnJ7PQkYZqxep/giphy.gif"></a></p><p>Anyhow I would recommend &lsquo;NoStartup&rsquo; launch command to skip the intro videos in case the game loads slow for you.</p><h3></h3><h3>Disable Hardware Acceleration For Browsers</h3><p>Disabling hardware acceleration will not only fix mouse input lag ingame but also release some free resources on your GPU and RAM.</p><p>To disable hardware acceleration on your navigator such as <strong>Chrome</strong>&hellip;</p><p>Go to the top right hand side of chrome window you&rsquo;ll see a three dots icon (menu) press that:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004" src="" alt="chrome menu settings" width="266" height="466" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-settings.jpg 266w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-settings-183x320.jpg 183w" sizes="(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-settings.jpg"></p><p>Search &ldquo;hardware&rdquo; then check off Use <strong>hardware acceleration when available</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1003 " src="" alt="chrome disable hardware acceleration" width="745" height="286" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration-1024x393.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration-622x239.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration-768x294.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration.jpg 1317w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration-1024x393.jpg"></a></p><p>If you use other browsers such as Brave, Opera or Firefox try the same procedure.</p><h3>Update Your Drivers</h3><p>I can not emphasize how crucial is to keep your drivers updated. A few months ago I purchased an external wifi card and plugged directly into my computer without installing the drivers then I started getting random BSOD errors (Blue Screen) at random days until I checked my event viewer to find error logs related to my wifi card.</p><p>It instantly hit me that I did not install any drivers so I installed my drivers then afterwards downloaded <a title="Driver Booster" href="https://www.iobit.com/en/driver-booster.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Driver Booster</a> just to double check my drivers are up to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Indeed the switch to SSD was the biggest performance improvement however some of the issues remained until I started investigating and figured out that malwarebytes along with unnecessary components have been hindering windows from delivering the perfect performance.</p><p>My recommendation to you is to keep your drivers updated especially when introducing a new device into your system such as an external usb wifi. Avoid Avast and AVG as they do impact your system severely but you can use better antivirus such as Comodo Internet Security (Free) or Kaspersky Free these two are perfect for gaming.</p><p>I hope this guide was helpful to you and let me know in the comment section if you have any issues with any version of age of empires 2.</p></p>

Thus, set your bitrate to 16bit 44.1k. (Or if you don&rsquo;t use a microphone disable it for better results.)</p><p>Right-click the sound icon in the taskbar.</p><p><img class="aligncenter" src="" alt="" width="248" height="143" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image009.png"></p><p>Click Properties &gt;</p><p><img class="aligncenter" src="" alt="" width="359" height="400" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image010.jpg"></p><p>Go to Advanced Tab &gt;</p><p>And make sure to set it at 16 bit, 44100Hz</p><p><img class="aligncenter" src="" alt="" width="359" height="477" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image011.png"></p><h3><strong>b- </strong><strong>Nvidia Users Only</strong></h3><p>This is what your Nvidia control panel should look like. Anti-aliasing does add latency, so I force it off. Texture filtering is going to occur regardless, so it doesn&rsquo;t really matter to what you set your anisotropic filtering.</p><p><img class="aligncenter" src="" alt="http://www.overclock.net/content/type/61/id/1699005/width/500/height/1000/flags/LL" width="324" height="305" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image012.png"></p><p>To reduce the hit on your graphics card, let&rsquo;s&nbsp;enable No scaling mode.</p><p><img class="aligncenter" title="no scaling reduce lag" src="" alt="no scaling reduce lag" width="442" height="288" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image013.png"></p><p>Leaving scaling on anything else incurs a large amount of input lag, even in native resolution. &ldquo;GPU &ndash; No scaling&rdquo; is also much laggier than the &ldquo;Display &ndash; No Scaling&rdquo; setting. This is bad because if you plug in a Korean IPS panel or any panel in with no hardware scaler, it forces you to use the extremely laggy &ldquo;GPU &ndash; No Scaling&rdquo; mode.</p><h2><strong>Disabling Useless Services And Built-in Features</strong></h2><h3><strong>c- </strong><strong>Services That Affect Mouse, Gameplay And Also Computer Performance</strong></h3><p>This part is very important.

Similar issue with other programs/Antivirus could also cause 100% disk usage. To fix this do the following:</p><p><strong><u>Google Chrome:</u></strong></p><p>In Google Chrome, go to Settings &gt; Show Advanced Settings &hellip; &gt; Privacy &gt; Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly</p><p>and untick it. See below:</p><p><img src="" alt="Image" width="624" height="492" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image016.png"></p><h3>100% Disk Usage Resulted From An Antivirus or Another Program</h3><p>Now Let me show you the trick to fix the 100% usage. If you would like to know why that happens?! It is because the program does not have write permission, so it keeps attempting to write over and over, causing the disk to overload. To fix It is quick easy:</p><p>For programs that are not Antivirus, simply run the task manager</p><p><img class="aligncenter" src="" alt="Image" width="442" height="409" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image017.png"></p><p>In this example, Skype is causing the 100% disk usage.</p><p>Now I am going right click &ldquo;Skype (32bit)(2)&rdquo; then click &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; and open the &ldquo;Security&rdquo; tab.</p><p>Click the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; button and then highlight &ldquo;ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES&rdquo; and place a tick in the &ldquo;Write&rdquo; box.</p><p>Click &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; and then &ldquo;OK&rdquo; and then &ldquo;OK&rdquo; again. See below:</p><p><img class="aligncenter" src="" alt="" width="307" height="401" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image018.jpg"></p><p><img class="aligncenter" src="" alt="Image" width="310" height="384" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image019.png"></p><p><img class="aligncenter" src="" alt="Image" width="305" height="379" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image020.png"></p><p>Immediately after you apply that the disk usage should drop to 0%. If it doesn&rsquo;t, do the same thing for other programs that are running.</p><h2><strong>IV- </strong><strong>Update your Drivers &amp; Clean Up Undetectable Adware/Malware/Junk</strong></h2><h3><strong>System &amp; Drivers</strong></h3><p>You are not allowed to skip this at all. Many of you may not care about outdated drivers in their system; As a result, You are putting your computer at a very high risk of BlueScreen, Low performance, Programs/games crashes, hardware damage, and so on.</p><p>So let&rsquo;s not waste more time and update the drivers now! Download and install Driver Booster 3 (It&rsquo;s free):<a href="https://www.techspot.com/downloads/4842-game-booster.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.techspot.com/downloads/4842-game-booster.html</a></p><p>(When you run the installer make sure to untick advanced system care, you don&rsquo;t need that)</p><p>Run Driver booster 3 Scan and wait until it&rsquo;s done and update all the outdated drivers.</p><p><strong>Adware, Malware, and Junk</strong></p><p>I hate to repeat myself again, but you are not allowed to skip this either xD</p><p>Viruses like Adware and Malware are one of the most viruses you never want on your pc. Finding Malware&nbsp;on your PC only&nbsp;means that you are being spied on and your internet accounts, the credit card all can be hacked or used by the malware creator at any moment.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t have an Antivirus get one soon. <a href="https://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Avast Free Antivirus</a> is recommended for even bad computers.</p><p>Anyways whether you have an Antivirus now or not. Let&rsquo;s check if you have any adware, malware, or junk (toolbars, search bar, etc.)</p><p>1- Download and run a scan with <strong>Malwarebytes</strong>: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Download Malwarebytes</a></p><p>Run the scan and clean at the end of the scan. Now you can restart your computer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>V-</strong><strong>Bonus Tips:</strong></h2><h3><strong>Fix Mouse Double Click</strong></h3><p>You&rsquo;ve an annoying right/left double click ? This archive contain 2 programs &ldquo;MouseFix.exe &amp; FixMouseLMB.exe&rdquo; try one of them and see what works for you: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/1qa6ueqkrgvch39/MouseFix.zip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/download/1qa6ueqkrgvch39/MouseFix.zip</a></p><p>The archive should be extracted it somewhere in your computer and run as administrator.</p><h3><strong>Fix loud USB Headset</strong></h3><p>Your USB headset has 1 or 2 volumes and It is still way too loud.</p><p>Download Equalizer APO:&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/</a></p><p>After you download you are going to want to run the installer. At some point it will ask you to select which devices you want to use the equalizer on. Select your headphones now.</p><p>Let the install finish then reboot.</p><p>After you reboot open the file C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config\config.txt, delete the contents and replace it with</p><p>Preamp: -12 dB</p><h3><strong>Unlock Higher Resolution and refresh rate with Nvidia/ATI/AMD!</strong></h3><p>You probably have tried before to add higher resolutions through Nvidia Panel, but to no avail?! Or you have Nvidia and you would like to extend your screen resolution?!</p><p>Yes, It is possible with a patch. But first, allow me to&nbsp;explain the refresh rate. It is the number of times that your screen blinks and displays images per second. Most standard screens have 60 Hz, and what you need to know here is that 60hz = 120 FPS output.</p><p>So the higher refresh rate the more FPS you gain to boost responsiveness and performance of both your game and mouse. So higher refresh rate is always better.</p><p>Back to the the Nvidia patch &ldquo;NVIDIA Pixel Clock Patcher&rdquo; which you can download right now from: <a href="http://www.monitortests.com/nvlddmkm-patcher-1.3.4.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.monitortests.com/nvlddmkm-patcher-1.3.4.zip</a></p><p>Run <strong>nvlddmkm-patcher-full.exe </strong>&gt; confirm the patch and restart your computer</p><p>This patch will allow you to add higher resolutions and refresh rates by removing the 165 MHz pixel clock limit for single-link DVI and HDMI. So this will work for people who have a monitor/screen plugged into their laptop or a desktop computer.</p><p>After patching you can add higher resolutions or higher refresh rates through Nvidia control panel or through this tool: <a href="http://www.monitortests.com/cru-1.2.4.zip">http://www.monitortests.com/cru-1.2.4.zip</a></p><p>For AMD and ATI users use this patch:</p><p>ATI/AMD Patch: <a href="http://www.monitortests.com/atikmdag-patcher-1.3.4.zip">http://www.monitortests.com/atikmdag-patcher-1.3.4.zip</a></p><p>That is all Ladies and Gentlemen <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Post a reply or contact me if you have further queries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
