<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What&#8217;s the solution?</strong></span></div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0">.PNG files should be all converted to a GPU friendly format such .DDS which is currently supported by AOE2 DE.</div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0"></div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Why PNG lower game performance?</strong></span></div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0">.PNG files are optimized for raw disk storage. DDS files textures are natively optimized and supported by GPUs and load way faster than PNG format or other lossless formats.</div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0"></div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Will .DDS files improve FPS and decrease memory usage?</strong></span></div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0">Yes, significantly.</div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0"></div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What&#8217;s the downside of .DDS format?</strong></span></div>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0">They take higher disk space compared to lossless png formats as a result the game size increases.</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0">Conclusion</h2>
<div data-offset-key="65i5v-0-0">Indeed switching to DDS is no easy task for the developers, It will take days or months to get it done but the outcome is guaranteed to bring about better FPS and less memory consumption. I should also point out that the <strong>current game menu and navigation could use a native support</strong> rather than a highly customizable .xaml UI panels. It is understood that the developers were very thoughtful and wanted to give us all the opportunity to fully customize the ingame UI but unfortunately that is done at the cost of performance.</div>

<p>Two months ago, I was one of the last users to receive a beta key for AoE2 DE. But anyhow I installed the game and ran it â I was so excited to test it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1011 size-large" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-1024x576.jpg" alt="main menu of age of empires 2 definitive" width="620" height="349" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/menu-aoe2de.jpg 1918w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>I immediately jumped into the single player to testâ¦and here we go.. an average of 25-30 fps to start with; rendering the game to freeze and crash within 15 mins.. Besides I couldnât help noticing that my audio was a bit choppier from moment to another.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, These are the issues I came across repeatedly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game crashed after 5 â 15 mins</li>
<li>Blackscreen then my audio is not working anymore (had to restart pc to fix)</li>
<li>Choppy sound at random moments and sometimes for the entire gameplay</li>
<li>Random frame drops and freezes</li>
<li>Game takes 2 â 3 minutes to run</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the benchmark tool and I got an average score of <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>580 &amp; 600ish</strong></span> out of 1000 even after lowering the settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very depressed and annoyed by that horrible experience so I started thinking and talking to myselfâ¦</p>
<p>Me: âI didnât format my computer HDD hard drive since 2012.. My graphics card is GT630M which is a medium requirement and my cpu is 8 cores. So could it be my HDD hard drive?â</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Switching to SSD Hard drive</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SSD-Vs-HDD.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1007" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SSD-Vs-HDD.jpg" alt="SSD Vs HDD" width="238" height="348" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SSD-Vs-HDD.jpg 590w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SSD-Vs-HDD-219x320.jpg 219w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" /></a></p>
<p>I went to the hardware store and purchased an SSD hard drive âSamsung EVO 860 1 TBâ (<strong>$200 cost</strong>). I asked the guy there to have it installed in my laptop as well as <strong>renewing my cpu thermal paste ($5 cost me) and dust removal for my cpu ($5).</strong></p>
<p>After the upgrade the computer turned into a turbo fast machine. I installed AoE2 DE through steam.</p>
<p>I run the game and the surprise happened..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game took <strong>less than 10 seconds to get to the main menu</strong>. I stood up and shoved my fist through the air: âF*** yeah!!!!â</p>
<p>I never thought an SSD would bring about so much speed improvement into my average pc. At that very moment I felt hope and then the first thing I was tempted to do is to run the benchmark tool.. Guess the results?</p>
<p>I got <strong>1100/1000</strong>. Yes Itâs <strong>1100</strong> out of 1000 no spelling mistakes!! with medium graphics not low profile. Remember in my old HDD I got 580/1000 so that makes for 50% improvement.</p>
<p>Here is my benchmark score for Team games (I have chrome open which explains why 1059.3 not 1100):</p>

<h2>Tips To Fix FPS Drops and Crashes Mid Game</h2>
<p><strong><em>(yet another section added to keep up with the issues that arise with Age of Empires II Definitive Edition)</em></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s 2022 and as a technical moderator at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reddit/r/aoe2</a>, I managed to keep track of issues/solutions and help several users within and outside the platform fix their problems. I will divide this section into two categories:</p>
<h3>Fix FPS Drops</h3>
<p>Countless users across all reddit forums have reported that the following programs reduce FPS significantly on many modern games including and specifically Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition:</p>
<p>Please Uninstall and remove completely the following programs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Citrix</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mcafee</strong></li>
<li><strong>Malwarebytes</strong></li>
<li><b>Bitdefender</b></li>
<li><strong>Avast Antivirus</strong></li>
<li><strong>AVG Antivirus</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These programs even if they are not running in the background, they make huge registry and system changes So the only way to undo that is through uninstalling.</p>
<h3>Fix Crashes Mid Game</h3>
<p>Crashes mid game are a result of one of the following:</p>

<h2>Sensei DE Tool For AoE2 DE</h2>
<p><strong><em>(This section has recently been added and is not part of my story. However the performance gain out of this tool is formidable with tangible proof.)</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2021, lots of things have changed.. The game state is improved significantly compared to 2019 yet a few hiccups in terms of performance are still there. So I created an open source tool to help optimize Age of empires 2 definitive edition even further. The kind of changes we are talking about are the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable/enable 38 hidden game effects and animations.</li>
<li>Shrink game resolution to any value from 10 to 100 (AoE2DE only allows 75%, 50%, 33%).</li>
<li>Disable Intro Videos</li>
<li>Optimize SplashScreen</li>
<li>Access to High Performance Graphics Profile</li>
<li>Install Your Mods as Offline And delete the online ones.</li>
<li>Manage all Mods across multiple steam accounts.</li>
<li>Optimal Windows Compatibility Settings</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch a live demo to see for yourself (Benchmark Tests at the end of the video).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Game Crashing and Freezing</h2>
<p>I may have succeeded in bringing the game performance to a higher level BUTâ¦. the crashes and freezes were often occurring in mysterious circumstances in which I had to investigate further.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- Horizontal_1_AoN -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-0608818284340124"
     data-ad-slot="7710422102"

     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p>These are the remaining issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>After 30 â 40 mins: Blackscreen then my audio is not working anymore (had to restart pc to fix)</li>
<li>Choppy sound at random moments and sometimes for the entire gameplay</li>
<li>2 out 15 games I crashed</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Change Power Settings</h3>
<p>I quickly changed my power plan to High Performance by pressing <kbd>Windows Key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to bring up the âRUNâ command then type in:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">powercfg.cpl</pre><p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance.jpg" alt="high performance power plan for aoe2 de" width="942" height="445" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance.jpg 942w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance-622x294.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/high-performance-768x363.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px" /></p>
<p>Then Select<strong> &#8220;High Performance Plan&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Â </strong></p>
<h3>Fix Crashes, Black-Screen &amp; Choppy Audio</h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>THIS IS THE BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT SECTION IN THIS GUIDE!</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Itâs 95% likely that the crashes and freezes would be long gone after this section.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1006 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-is-not-responding.jpeg" alt="Fix for Crashing, Freezing and Blackscreen/Audio issues" width="650" height="387" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-is-not-responding.jpeg 650w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-is-not-responding-537x320.jpeg 537w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>It is funny how the crashing, blackscreen and audio were so related and linked with each other. If the game does not crash the sound is gone or the game crashes and the sound is not gone.</p>
<p>So basically, it does not take a genius to come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming to how I fixed all thatâ¦</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- Horizontal_2_AoN -->

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

<p>I used two programs:</p>
<p><a title="DPC Latency Checker" href="https://www.thesycon.de/eng/latency_check.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DPC Latency Checker</a></p>
<p><a title="LatencyMon" href="https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6944-latencymon.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LatencyMon</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I closed all applications and every window on my desktop before I ran the tests.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Diagnosing with DPC Latency</h4>
<p>I ran DPC Latency Checker, pressed start button to check my audio latency for about 2 minutes then I saw</p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-989 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars.jpg" alt="DPC Latency Checker diagnosing on windows 10" width="586" height="493" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars.jpg 586w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars-380x320.jpg 380w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Red-Bars-75x63.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px" /></a></p>
<p>OMGâ¦. Do you see those Red bars? Briefly.. they are audio latency spikes that potentially trigger all the three issues together: Blackscreen, Sound not working and crashing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully I have fixed this issue before for a friend that had nearly the same thing in league of legends game.</p>
<p>So without hesitation I ran my âDevice Managerâ by pressing <kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to bring up the âRUNâ command again and typed in:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">devmgmt.msc</pre><p>

<p>I disabled the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>System devices &gt; [x] High precision event timer (Right Click &gt; Disable)</li>
<li>Bluetooth &gt; [x] IntelÂ® Wireless Bluetooth (Right Click &gt; Disable)</li>
<li>Cameras &gt; [x] Any laptop integrated webcam (Right Click &gt; Disable)</li>
<li>Network adapters &gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">disabled all IÂ adapters I do not use and since I use an external wifi card this is What I ended up doing (read below for a detailed explanation).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/device-manager-disable-devices-to-improve-performance.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-992 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/device-manager-disable-devices-to-improve-performance.jpg" alt="device manager disable devices to improve latency and performance" width="760" height="543" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/device-manager-disable-devices-to-improve-performance.jpg 760w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/device-manager-disable-devices-to-improve-performance-448x320.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Which network adapters to disable and the one to keep enabled?</strong></p>
<p>Again press <kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> then type this in:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">ncpa.cpl</pre><p>
<a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/network-connections.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-991 size-large" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/network-connections-1024x290.jpg" alt="disabling network adapters we don't need" width="620" height="176" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/network-connections-1024x290.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/network-connections-622x176.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/network-connections-768x218.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/network-connections.jpg 1112w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><br />
The picture above reveals that i&#8217;m using â802.11n USB Wireless LAN Cardâ so now I can disable the rest of the network adapters (the same image shows that i disabled the rest of the adapters.</p>
<p>(I will run DPC Latency checker test and show the results right after LatencyMon diagnose)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Diagnosing with LatencyMon</h4>
<p>This tool is perfect to find out the execution time for drivers in other words how responsive are your drivers with your system.</p>
<p>So I ran LatencyMon and slapped that green play button</p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/running-latencymon.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-994 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/running-latencymon.jpg" alt="running latencymon" width="836" height="209" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/running-latencymon.jpg 836w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/running-latencymon-622x156.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/running-latencymon-768x192.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px" /></a></p>
<p>After 30 seconds&#8230; I switched to the Drivers tab to see whatâs up then once againâ¦ OMGâ¦</p>

<p>Ndis.sys is 1.9 which is nearly 2 ms seconds and thatâs an absolute huge delay. It took me nearly an hour to find the culprit. Continue reading&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Uninstalling MalwareBytes</h4>
<p>This has reduced Ndis.sys from 1.9 ms to 0.9ms so this step is 100% valuable.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Although Malwarebytes was only installed but not running on my windows</span>â¦ I did a research and a lot of people pointed fingers to uninstalling Malwarebytes and antiviruses.</p>
<p>So I uninstalled Malwarebytes completely from my machine anyway. And that my friends immediately showed a <strong>-1 ms</strong> improvement which is a big deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

<p>If you donât have Malwarebytes I advise you to temporarily uninstall any antivirus such as: AVAST, AVG, MCAFE, BITDEFENDER, etc.</p>
<p>Only got Windows Defender? In that case you just have to disable it using <a title="Defender control tool" href="https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v1-6/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Defender control tool</a></p>

<h4>Uninstalling Nvidia 3D Vision &amp; Physics Software</h4>
<p>Go to the search bar and type in: <strong>Add or remove programs</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-remove-programs-windows.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-995" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-remove-programs-windows.jpg" alt="add remove programs windows 10" width="509" height="501" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-remove-programs-windows.jpg 693w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-remove-programs-windows-325x320.jpg 325w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /></a></p>
<p>Type in there âNvidiaâ as show below</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-996" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver.jpg" alt="Uninstalling Nvidia 3D Vision &amp; Physics Software" width="466" height="427" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver.jpg 804w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver-350x320.jpg 350w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-graphics-driver-768x703.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see in the image I only have âNvidia Graphics Driverâ. I have already uninstalled âNvidia 3D Visionâ and âNvidia Physics Softwareâ. The pinpoint here is to only keep âNvidia Graphics Driverâ installed while uninstalling the rest because you may find others so just uninstall them all. They are only additional/optional components that happen to slow down your GPU.</p>
<p>Next you want to do a clean install of Nvidia drivers just to ensure as follow</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-nvcleanstall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVCleannstall</a></li>
<li>Make <a href="https://youtu.be/2-Zcc67EDRY?t=1021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a clean Nvidia install</a></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Test Results for DPC Latency &amp; LatencyMon</strong></span></p>
<p>After uninstalling Malwarebytes and Nvidia additional components as described above I was impressed with DPC Latency test:</p>
<figure id="attachment_997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-997" style="width: 587px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-997" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Stablizes.jpg" alt="DPC Latency test results after the tweaking" width="587" height="493" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Stablizes.jpg 587w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Stablizes-381x320.jpg 381w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DPC-Stablizes-75x63.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-997" class="wp-caption-text">DPC Latency test results after the tweaking</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then LatencyMon test showed mind-blowing improvement for ndis.sys that dropped from 1.9 ms to 0.2 ms which is a magnificent improvement.</p>
<figure id="attachment_998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-998" style="width: 782px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/latencymon-after.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-998 " src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/latencymon-after-1024x259.png" alt="latencymon test results after the tweaking" width="782" height="198" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/latencymon-after-1024x259.png 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/latencymon-after-622x157.png 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/latencymon-after-768x194.png 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/latencymon-after.png 1426w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-998" class="wp-caption-text">latencymon test results after the tweaking</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally I would like to bring to your attention to a sound tweak trick that reduces the latency even more.</p>
<p>Once again press <kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> and type in:</p><pre class="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag">mmsys.cpl</pre><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select whatever playback device is set to default and has a check mark then click properties button.</p>

<p>Go to enhancements tab and disable all enhancements</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sound-disable-enhancements.jpg" alt="disable sound enhancements which greatly helps with game performance" width="437" height="550" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sound-disable-enhancements.jpg 437w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sound-disable-enhancements-254x320.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /></p>
<p>Then go to Advanced Tab and select â16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)â</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sound-cd-quality.jpg" alt="reduce sound quality profile to CD quality" width="437" height="550" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sound-cd-quality.jpg 437w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sound-cd-quality-254x320.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /></p>
<p>Repeat the same steps for your microphone device or other sound devices.</p>
<p>You may ask why do we opt for CD quality profile? Simply because that profile employs less Hz which is an add to your overall system resource consumption.</p>
<h4>Disable Monitor Audio</h4>
<p><strong>Your Laptop is connected to a monitor screen?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1020 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/laptop-connected-plugged-to-monitor.jpg" alt="laptop plugged into monitor" width="342" height="166" /></p>
<p>Nvidia users are concerned with this. <strong>Because of &#8220;Nvidia High Definition Audio&#8221;</strong>, your graphics card is doing extra work and consuming more graphics memory. Only if your graphics card is medium power you must disable Nvidia High Definition Audio which by itself disables your monitor audio.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1021 size-full" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nvidia-high-definition-audio-disable-it-e1580920802557.png" alt="nvidia high definition audio disable it" width="392" height="107" /></p>
<p>Double check the sound settings to make sure your monitor audio is no longer detected. This way your graphics card will spike less (<em>spikes often trigger crashes and BSOD</em>)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Reducing your resolution a bit contributes significantly into reducing the resource usage and input lag therefore less occurring spikes.Â </span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bonus Tips</h2>
<p>While my issues have been fixed without these bonus tips, I feel urged to share them because I use them myself for most of my steam games.</p>
<h3>Launch Commands</h3>
<p>I have written a post a few weeks ago about Launch commands in AoE2 DE (<a href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition/#Launch_Commands">https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition/#Launch_Commands</a>) in case you have issues such as horizontal blacklines or sound blaster issues. Youâll find there the many commands to put into usage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/fYSKWOnJ7PQkYZqxep/giphy.gif"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fYSKWOnJ7PQkYZqxep/giphy.gif" alt="AoE2 DE Commands" width="480" height="327" /></a></p>
<p>Anyhow I would recommend âNoStartupâ launch command to skip the intro videos in case the game loads slow for you.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Disable Hardware Acceleration For Browsers</h3>
<p>Disabling hardware acceleration will not only fix mouse input lag ingame but also release some free resources on your GPU and RAM.</p>
<p>To disable hardware acceleration on your navigator such as <strong>Chrome</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>Go to the top right hand side of chrome window you&#8217;ll see a three dots icon (menu) press that:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-settings.jpg" alt="chrome menu settings" width="266" height="466" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-settings.jpg 266w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-settings-183x320.jpg 183w" sizes="(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px" /></p>
<p>Search &#8220;hardware&#8221; then check off Use <strong>hardware acceleration when available</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1003 " src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration-1024x393.jpg" alt="chrome disable hardware acceleration" width="745" height="286" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration-1024x393.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration-622x239.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration-768x294.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrome-disable-hardware-acceleration.jpg 1317w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /></a></p>
<p>If you use other browsers such as Brave, Opera or Firefox try the same procedure.</p>
<h3>Update Your Drivers</h3>
<p>I can not emphasize how crucial is to keep your drivers updated. A few months ago I purchased an external wifi card and plugged directly into my computer without installing the drivers then I started getting random BSOD errors (Blue Screen) at random days until I checked my event viewer to find error logs related to my wifi card.</p>
<p>It instantly hit me that I did not install any drivers so I installed my drivers then afterwards downloaded <a title="Driver Booster" href="https://www.iobit.com/en/driver-booster.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Driver Booster</a> just to double check my drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Indeed the switch to SSD was the biggest performance improvement however some of the issues remained until I started investigating and figured out that malwarebytes along with unnecessary components have been hindering windows from delivering the perfect performance.</p>
<p>My recommendation to you is to keep your drivers updated especially when introducing a new device into your system such as an external usb wifi. Avoid Avast and AVG as they do impact your system severely but you can use better antivirus such as Comodo Internet Security (Free) or Kaspersky Free these two are perfect for gaming.</p>
<p>I hope this guide was helpful to you and let me know in the comment section if you have any issues with any version of age of empires 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just 2 days ago (October, 28 2018) while I was practicing a strategy versus an AI, I ran into a weird glitch in Age of Empires 2 âUserPatch 1.5 / Wololokingdoms 5.8.1â where my villagers were actually able to climb a âVâ shaped cliff. I first thought it was just a one-time glitch therefore I restarted a new game with a different map generation and send my villagers straight to every cliff I could see then I succeeded to replicate the glitch especially with âVâ shaped or long cliffs.</p>
<div class="su-youtube su-u-responsive-media-yes"><iframe width="320" height="280" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJ_Ug29YFe8?autohide=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;controls=1&amp;fs=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;showinfo=1&amp;theme=light&amp;wmode=&amp;playsinline=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" title=""></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above is video demonstrating how I was able to walk through the cliffs all the way to the top.</p>
<p>Has time come for villagers to climb cliffs or this is just a glitch, huh? Please feel free to test and let us know.</p>
<p>The nasty part is when a player thinks that a cliff is forming a free wall for him while in fact it is a passage for an enemy to build secret bases and smuggle units through without you knowing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to protect yourself from this glitch?</strong></p>
<p>Simply placing pieces of palisade walls at the end of the âVâ shaped cliff or walling the cliff should do it the trick.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout this guide, I will help you maximize the performance of age of empires 2 on windows 10. This will also help fix random and constant freezes, mouse lag that may occur during the multiplayer gameplay or a streaming session.</p>
<h2>I- Voobly Client Setup:</h2>
<p><strong> <u>Make Age of Empires 2 runs at the top performance possible. This is also going to solve game settings that do not save after you change them like (hotkeys, map settings, profile etc.)</u></strong></p>
<p>Login to Voobly Client &gt; Enter a Lobby&gt; Host a room</p>
<p>And apply these settings</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image001.png" alt="" width="378" height="494" /></p>
<h3>Userpatch 1.5RCÂ  Voobly Room Settings</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://userpatch.aiscripters.net/guide-beta.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Userpatch team</a> Age of Empires 2 has gotten so much better in terms of latency and <a title="Improve Your Multitasking in Age Of Empires 2" href="https://ageofnotes.com/beginners/improve-multitasking-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improving your game mechanics</a>. Hereby I introduce you to a screenshot of recommended game room settings (players from steam are highly recommended to apply them)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-389 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/voobly-1.5rc-room-settings.jpg" alt="voobly 1.5rc room settings" width="439" height="288" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/voobly-1.5rc-room-settings.jpg 648w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/voobly-1.5rc-room-settings-488x320.jpg 488w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></p>
<p><strong>Precision Scrolling System:</strong> Improves cursor precision and potentially fix mouse issues for players from steam.</p>
<p><strong>Multiqueue:</strong> Improve your game mechanics by selecting military buildings and clicking a unit hotkey multiple times. Units build synchronically from every building.</p>
<p><strong>Keydown Object Hotkeys:</strong> The restore of key-down feature that players on steam are used to.</p>
<p><strong>Shift Group Appending:</strong>Â Improve your game mechanics by avoiding boxing and resetting hotkeys for your units and build. With this feature on. E.g simply hold <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> and press key <kbd>1</kbd>. The unit or building will be automatically added to your control group &#8220;1&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, On the top menu of the Lobby, click help&gt; Open Voobly Directory</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image002.png" alt="" width="416" height="255" /></p>
<p>Voobly Installation folder will pop up. Goto \gamedata\aoc\ folder &gt;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image003.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/FvEER3I.png" width="402" height="206" /></p>
<p>Find <strong>age2_x1.exe</strong> &gt; right click it &gt; properties</p>
<p>And apply these settings:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-383" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/age-of-empires-2-compatibility-settings.jpg" alt="age of empires 2 compatibility settings" width="319" height="425" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/age-of-empires-2-compatibility-settings.jpg 487w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/age-of-empires-2-compatibility-settings-240x320.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the same folder, there is another folder named \userpatch\:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image005.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/LRIcmCX.png" width="401" height="181" /></p>
<p>Inside that folder, you find another â<strong>age2_x1.exe</strong>â apply the same thing to it as well.</p>
<h2><strong>II- </strong>Windows 10 Theme &amp; Virtual Ram:</h2>
<p><strong>Adjusting the Virtual Ram to boost CPU performance:</strong></p>
<p>Click onÂ <strong>StartÂ </strong>&gt;Â <strong>File Explorer</strong>. Right-click onÂ <strong>This PC</strong>Â &gt;Â <strong>Properties</strong>Â &gt;Â <strong>Advanced System Settings</strong>Â &gt;<strong>Advanced</strong>Â tab &gt;Â <strong>Performance</strong>Â and then click on theÂ <strong>SettingsÂ </strong>button:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image006.jpg" alt="http://static.ccm2.net/ccm.net/faq/images/jeWb4Gherti5xEa4efKQAaIoU4xvYiKWxWUjvlAYdVTanOQJ8hmyS8xeffSHOM8i-se1-s-.png" width="335" height="381" /></p>
<p>In the<strong>Â Performance Options</strong>Â window, go toÂ <strong>Virtual memory</strong>Â section and click onÂ <strong>Change</strong>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image007.png" alt="http://static.ccm2.net/ccm.net/faq/images/KJ9mFmljoKkkkLsWOlNLsMxB6G4hK5AfjH3bhPgXSBSMWrODbv7ct1ZEtzsm79hR-se2-s-.png" width="282" height="415" /></p>
<p>By default the size of the paging file is being managed by Windows, so the first step is to clear the <strong>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</strong>Â checkbox:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image008.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="456" /></p>
<p>In the image above you can see that I have set a custom size for both my drives to a value that is: 12000 (MB) because I have 6 Gb of Ram and basically the rule of thumb says that you should make your virtual ram to twice the size of your real Ram.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>If you have 2 Gb of Ram which is 2000 (MB) Then your virtual ram should be 2000&#215;2= 4000 =&gt; So 4000 is the value you need to set per each drive.</p>
<h3><strong>Use Windows 10 Classic Theme to Free up Memory Usage</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. </strong>PressÂ <strong>Win+R</strong>Â keys together to launch RUN dialog box. Now typeÂ <strong>sysdm.cpl</strong>Â and press Enter. It&#8217;ll open classic System Properties window.</p>

<h2><strong>III- </strong><strong>Mouse Input Lag and Annoying Freezes</strong></h2>
<p>This part of the tutorial should cover and fix all the mouse lag issues within the multiplayer and singleplayer. Besides that, It will also cover common freezing problems; for instance random freezes, frequent freezes, sudden crashes etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Fix Your Laggy Mouse And Improve Its Responsiveness</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>a- </strong><strong>Sound:</strong></h3>
<p>Having your sound set to higher bitrate will cause a huge hit to mouse response. Thus, set your bitrate to 16bit 44.1k. (Or if you don&#8217;t use a microphone disable it for better results.)</p>
<p>Right-click the sound icon in the taskbar.</p>

<p>Click Properties &gt;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image010.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="400" /></p>
<p>Go to Advanced Tab &gt;</p>
<p>And make sure to set it at 16 bit, 44100Hz</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image011.png" alt="" width="359" height="477" /></p>
<h3><strong>b- </strong><strong>Nvidia Users Only</strong></h3>
<p>This is what your Nvidia control panel should look like. Anti-aliasing does add latency, so I force it off. Texture filtering is going to occur regardless, so it doesn&#8217;t really matter to what you set your anisotropic filtering.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image012.png" alt="http://www.overclock.net/content/type/61/id/1699005/width/500/height/1000/flags/LL" width="324" height="305" /></p>
<p>To reduce the hit on your graphics card, let&#8217;sÂ enable No scaling mode.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" title="no scaling reduce lag" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image013.png" alt="no scaling reduce lag" width="442" height="288" /></p>
<p>Leaving scaling on anything else incurs a large amount of input lag, even in native resolution. &#8220;GPU &#8211; No scaling&#8221; is also much laggier than the &#8220;Display &#8211; No Scaling&#8221; setting. This is bad because if you plug in a Korean IPS panel or any panel in with no hardware scaler, it forces you to use the extremely laggy &#8220;GPU &#8211; No Scaling&#8221; mode.</p>
<h2><strong>Disabling Useless Services And Built-in Features</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>c- </strong><strong>Services That Affect Mouse, Gameplay And Also Computer Performance</strong></h3>
<p>This part is very important. It will reduce massive memory usage and surely this should fix your 100% memory usage at the task manager.</p>
<p>First of all, letâs run the services panel: Click <strong>Windows button + R</strong> and type in <strong>services.msc</strong></p>
<p>A window will show up containing a long list of services. Right-click every service mentioned below and make sure to set the Startup type to disabled and click the stop button as in the example below as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image014.png" alt="" width="300" height="339" /></p>
<p>Here are the services you need to disable and stop:</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostics Tracking Service</strong>Â &#8211; Disable <strong>Geolocation Service</strong>Â &#8211; Disable <strong>Dmwappushsvc</strong>Â &#8211; Disable (related to the keylogging ability of win10) <strong>Network connection broker</strong>Â &#8211; disable (I believe this service had a dependency in Win 8.1 where it was more difficult to get rid of) <strong>Tile data model server</strong>Â &#8211; disable â If unable to disable it, Click Windows button + R , type in regedit and do the following (hkey_local_machine &gt; system &gt; currentcontrolset &gt; services &gt; tiledatamodelsvc &#8211; Set &#8220;start&#8221; key to 4 to disable</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Acrobat Update Service </strong>â disable ( some of you may not find it in that case skip to the next service) <strong>Windows Error Reporting service</strong>Â &#8211; disable <strong>Background intelligent transfer service</strong>Â &#8211; this usually stayed off when set to manual on Win 8.1, but Win10 wants to keep it on all the time so if you disable it, you will have to re-enable to run Windows update</p>
<p><strong>Themes </strong>â disable (This will disable windows themes service)</p>
<p><strong>Windows Defender</strong>&#8211; disable</p>
<p><strong>Windows Search</strong>&#8211; disable</p>
<p><strong>Windows Update</strong>&#8211; disable</p>
<p><strong>Print Spooler</strong>&#8211; disable (Do not disable if you have a printer)</p>
<p><strong>Disable Useless Windows Features</strong></p>
<p>Disabling some of the pointless windows 10 features will reduce system space that is usually from 700 &#8211; 1000 MB to all the way down to less than 600 MB.</p>
<p>Go to the control panel &gt; programs and features &gt; &#8220;Turn Windows Features On/Off&#8221; and uninstall the following until the menu looks like this:</p>
<p>&#8211; Internet Explorer 11 &#8211; first turn off smooth scrolling in the options menu of IE, then turn off automatic updating under the &#8220;about&#8221; section of IE.</p>
<p>&#8211; Print and document services (in you don&#8217;t use one)</p>
<p>&#8211; SMB 1.0/CIFS file sharing support</p>
<p>&#8211; Windows Location Provider</p>
<p>&#8211; Work folders client</p>
<p>&#8211; XPS services</p>

<h3><strong>100% Disk Usage Fix For Windows 10/8.1</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-384 aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/100-disk-usage-fix.jpg" alt="100%-disk-usage-fix" width="381" height="351" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/100-disk-usage-fix.jpg 640w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/100-disk-usage-fix-348x320.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /></p>
<p>This is caused by a common combination of Skype as well as Google Chrome. Similar issue with other programs/Antivirus could also cause 100% disk usage. To fix this do the following:</p>
<p><strong><u>Google Chrome:</u></strong></p>
<p>In Google Chrome, go to Settings &gt; Show Advanced Settings &#8230; &gt; Privacy &gt; Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly</p>
<p>and untick it. See below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image016.png" alt="Image" width="624" height="492" /></p>
<h3>100% Disk Usage Resulted From An Antivirus or Another Program</h3>
<p>Now Let me show you the trick to fix the 100% usage. If you would like to know why that happens?! It is because the program does not have write permission, so it keeps attempting to write over and over, causing the disk to overload. To fix It is quick easy:</p>
<p>For programs that are not Antivirus, simply run the task manager</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image017.png" alt="Image" width="442" height="409" /></p>
<p>In this example, Skype is causing the 100% disk usage.</p>
<p>Now I am going right click &#8220;Skype (32bit)(2)&#8221; then click &#8220;Properties&#8221; and open the &#8220;Security&#8221; tab.</p>
<p>Click the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button and then highlight &#8220;ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES&#8221; and place a tick in the &#8220;Write&#8221; box.</p>
<p>Click &#8220;Apply&#8221; and then &#8220;OK&#8221; and then &#8220;OK&#8221; again. See below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image018.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="401" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image019.png" alt="Image" width="310" height="384" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://ageofnotes.com/Age%20of%20empires%202%20Max%20Performance%20on%20Windows%2010_files/image020.png" alt="Image" width="305" height="379" /></p>
<p>Immediately after you apply that the disk usage should drop to 0%. If it doesnât, do the same thing for other programs that are running.</p>
<h2><strong>IV- </strong><strong>Update your Drivers &amp; Clean Up Undetectable Adware/Malware/Junk</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>System &amp; Drivers</strong></h3>
<p>You are not allowed to skip this at all. Many of you may not care about outdated drivers in their system; As a result, You are putting your computer at a very high risk of BlueScreen, Low performance, Programs/games crashes, hardware damage, and so on.</p>
<p>So letâs not waste more time and update the drivers now! Download and install Driver Booster 3 (Itâs free):<a href="https://www.techspot.com/downloads/4842-game-booster.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.techspot.com/downloads/4842-game-booster.html</a></p>
<p>(When you run the installer make sure to untick advanced system care, you donât need that)</p>
<p>Run Driver booster 3 Scan and wait until itâs done and update all the outdated drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Adware, Malware, and Junk</strong></p>
<p>I hate to repeat myself again, but you are not allowed to skip this either xD</p>
<p>Viruses like Adware and Malware are one of the most viruses you never want on your pc. Finding MalwareÂ on your PC onlyÂ means that you are being spied on and your internet accounts, the credit card all can be hacked or used by the malware creator at any moment.</p>

<h2><strong>V-</strong><strong>Bonus Tips:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Fix Mouse Double Click</strong></h3>
<p>Youâve an annoying right/left double click ? This archive contain 2 programs âMouseFix.exe &amp; FixMouseLMB.exeâ try one of them and see what works for you: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/1qa6ueqkrgvch39/MouseFix.zip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/download/1qa6ueqkrgvch39/MouseFix.zip</a></p>
<p>The archive should be extracted it somewhere in your computer and run as administrator.</p>
<h3><strong>Fix loud USB Headset</strong></h3>
<p>Your USB headset has 1 or 2 volumes and It is still way too loud.</p>
<p>Download Equalizer APO:Â <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/</a></p>
<p>After you download you are going to want to run the installer. At some point it will ask you to select which devices you want to use the equalizer on. Select your headphones now.</p>
<p>Let the install finish then reboot.</p>
<p>After you reboot open the file C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config\config.txt, delete the contents and replace it with</p>
<p>Preamp: -12 dB</p>
<h3><strong>Unlock Higher Resolution and refresh rate with Nvidia/ATI/AMD!</strong></h3>
<p>You probably have tried before to add higher resolutions through Nvidia Panel, but to no avail?! Or you have Nvidia and you would like to extend your screen resolution?!</p>
<p>Yes, It is possible with a patch. But first, allow me toÂ explain the refresh rate. It is the number of times that your screen blinks and displays images per second. Most standard screens have 60 Hz, and what you need to know here is that 60hz = 120 FPS output.</p>
<p>So the higher refresh rate the more FPS you gain to boost responsiveness and performance of both your game and mouse. So higher refresh rate is always better.</p>
<p>Back to the the Nvidia patch âNVIDIA Pixel Clock Patcherâ which you can download right now from: <a href="http://www.monitortests.com/nvlddmkm-patcher-1.3.4.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.monitortests.com/nvlddmkm-patcher-1.3.4.zip</a></p>
<p>Run <strong>nvlddmkm-patcher-full.exe </strong>&gt; confirm the patch and restart your computer</p>
<p>This patch will allow you to add higher resolutions and refresh rates by removing the 165 MHz pixel clock limit for single-link DVI and HDMI. So this will work for people who have a monitor/screen plugged into their laptop or a desktop computer.</p>
<p>After patching you can add higher resolutions or higher refresh rates through Nvidia control panel or through this tool: <a href="http://www.monitortests.com/cru-1.2.4.zip">http://www.monitortests.com/cru-1.2.4.zip</a></p>
<p>For AMD and ATI users use this patch:</p>
<p>ATI/AMD Patch: <a href="http://www.monitortests.com/atikmdag-patcher-1.3.4.zip">http://www.monitortests.com/atikmdag-patcher-1.3.4.zip</a></p>
