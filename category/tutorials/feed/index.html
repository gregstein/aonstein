										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This guide will help you make the jump from Beginner and intermediate level into upper-intermediate and higher.<p>Rest assured! You will not waste your time here because most these tips are priceless and meant to particularly improve the mechanical aspect of your gameplay.&nbsp; These tricks may only apply to Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_1]</p><h2>Mechanics &amp; Tricks</h2><p>The release of the definitive edition has been a blessing so far particularly in the amount of brand new mechanics that brings to the table.</p><p>In this section you will learn most of those fancy tricks that the pros employ everyday. The rest of them will be covered in the other sections of this guide.</p><p>Instead of writing down a how to use text section for every trick I feel it would be more interesting and easy to grasp if I render short clips for a tangible live-preview.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Re-assigning Units With a Simple Trick</h3><p>Why? It prevents you from idling villagers after they construct whatever you assigned to. Or re-assigning siege rams for instance to destroy buildings in a particular order.</p><p>Hotkey Combination: <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + Mouse (Right Click)</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKegybKYNl4&Prime;]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Hill Fights</h3><p>
<div id="attachment_967" style="width: 422px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-967" class="wp-image-967 " src="" alt="Always take uphill fights" width="412" height="232" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uphill-fight-1024x576.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-967" class="wp-caption-text">Always take uphill fights</p></div>
</p><p>Why? Fighting uphills while Enemy down-hills inflects 25% <strong>BONUS</strong> damage to the enemy. Fighting down-hill reduces damage by 25%&nbsp;to units uphill.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaOu_wgDGog&rdquo;]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Boar Lure Like a Pro</h3><p>Why? Gain time &amp; efficiency.</p><p>Hotkey Combination (1): <kbd>H</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> +Mouse (Right Click)&nbsp; [Using Classic Hotkeys]</p><p>OR My Personal Combination(2): <kbd>4</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> + Mouse (Right Click) [ Changed &lsquo;Set Gather Point&rsquo; hotkey to <kbd>F</kbd>]</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mePacWWfgAo&rdquo;]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Hotkeying Shepherds</h3><p>Why? For 3 reasons:</p><ol>
<li>Take Full Control of your Shepherds so they would not kill sheep you don&rsquo;t want them to.</li>
<li>Quickly drop food onto your town center.</li>
<li>Killing boars at ease.</li>
</ol><p>My Personal Hotkey Combination: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd></p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NA-cz3OxG4&Prime;]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Quick Walls</h3><p>Why? Prevent or render dark or feudal age militia/scout rushes useless. (Grid Mod is recommended as one square represents the foundation for the palisade.)</p><p>Hotkey Combination: <kbd>B</kbd> + Wheel Up (Mouse) [Changed &lsquo;Palisade wall&rsquo; hotkey to Wheel Up for a faster reaction)</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-enjehv9A4&Prime;]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Hotkeys For Technologies</h3><p>Why? Gain time and never switch the point of view in the middle of a fight.</p><p>Access the main menu or while in-game Press <kbd>F10</kbd> &gt; &nbsp;<strong>Options</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&gt;</span> <strong>Hotkeys</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&gt; </span><strong>Blacksmith; Archery Range; etc. &lt;= Set your own hotkeys for technologies.</strong></p><p>

</p><h2>Static Hotkeys</h2><p>Great news! AoE2 DE comes exclusively with lots of advanced hotkeys unlike the previous editions of the conquerors and 2013( a.k.a HD). So&hellip; Are you taking advantage of them yet?</p><p>Even if you have I am pretty sure you are missing out on setting static control groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Problem</span></strong></p><p>For example, I use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> on my Town Center(s) &amp; <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> on all my buildings. In the early game it&rsquo;s a breeze to bind my barracks, stables and archery ranges all together using <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd>. The reasoning behind that is to set the rally point for all my military building into a desired location (extremely helpful to assist aggression and not idling army).</p><p>However.. In Imperial Age or Post-Castle-Age I have many military buildings distributed across the map and at different locations..&nbsp; And that makes it hard to bind them all under <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd>.&nbsp; Though my APM is high, I lose 2 to 5 seconds looking for my buildings and rebinding them.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_2]</p><p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Solution</strong></span></p><p>In Age of Empires 2, The Definitive Edition there is a hotkey item that selects all military buildings as well as select all town centers. Now we are going to change it to your desired number. In my case, Select All Military Buildings is set to <kbd>5</kbd>; Select All Town centers is set to <kbd>4</kbd></p><p>Where to find these hotkey items?</p><p>Go to: <strong>Options</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&gt;</span> <strong>Hotkeys</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Game Commands</strong></span></span></p><p>Scroll down a little bit until you find them. Screenshot..</p><p>
<div id="attachment_960" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-960" class="wp-image-960 size-large" src="" alt="select all hotkeys" width="620" height="202" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs-1024x333.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs-622x203.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs-768x250.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs.jpg 1293w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-all-military-tcs-1024x333.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-960" class="wp-caption-text">I got an AZERTY keyboard layout that explains &ldquo;5&rdquo; appearing as open bracket and &ldquo;4&rdquo; appearing as single quote.</p></div>
</p><p>From now on.. 4, and 5 become static control hotkeys and you never have to press the combination key <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> to bind your military buildings, or <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> your Town Centers ever again.&nbsp; Besides an economic advantage is that you can multi-queue villagers from all Town Centers without switching view.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_3]</p><p>For example, I can take a fight and at the same time click once on number <kbd>4</kbd> then <kbd>C</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. This way I&rsquo;m fighting and queuing villagers from 3 town centers without changing view to all of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Building Your Rhythm</h2><p>
<div id="attachment_965" style="width: 440px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-965" class="wp-image-965 size-full" src="" alt="Finding your game rhythm in age of empires 2" width="430" height="311" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aoe2-morten-harket-rhythm.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-965" class="wp-caption-text">Morten Harket/A-HA</p></div>
</p><p>Every living thing in this world has a rhythm or a music..&nbsp; So what&rsquo;s a rhythm? In a nutshell it is an unconscious habit that puts order into our lives.</p><p>It could be a daily rhythm such as: <strong>(a)</strong>Take Breakfast&nbsp; <strong>(b)</strong>Go To School <strong>(c)</strong>Take Lunch <strong>(d)</strong> Go To school <strong>(e)</strong>Play video-games<strong> (f)</strong>Watch TV <strong>(g)</strong>Go to Sleep&hellip; Repeat.</p><p>Or a rhythm constituting a task. A very good example of that are musicians and what makes a good rhythmical song is the chorus or refrain that remains unchanged and occurs repeatedly in a song.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_4]</p><p>For instance if we analyse &ldquo;Take on me&rdquo; a song by A-HA (Morten Harket). The following lines occur after every section of the song:</p><blockquote>
<div class="secrsf">Take on me (take on me)<br>
Take me on (take on me)<br>
I&rsquo;ll be gone<br>
In a day or two</div>
</blockquote><p>Back To Age of Empires 2.. Where I will be showing you how to build up your rhythm to organize your game-play to the better&hellip;</p><p>First of all and through out the game we need to organize our multitasking and build up a repetitive sequence of tasks.</p><p>For example and speaking of myself as an experienced player in this game, I like to organize my tasks (rhythm) as follow:</p><p>[su_table]</p><table class="editorDemoTable">
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>My Rhythm Explained</strong></td>
<td><strong>Hotkeys Used</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Go to my Town Center(s) and do something with it.</td>
<td>Control group <kbd>4</kbd> or <kbd>H</kbd> key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Check my scout or army and do something with them</td>
<td>Control group <kbd>1</kbd> and advanced commands (attack, stance ground, etc.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Check the mini-map to spot enemies or resources, check time, my collected resources and population.</td>
<td>No hotkeys just eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Check my lumberjacks, foragers, shephards, hunters and miners</td>
<td>I use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> to switch view to lumberjacks. <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> to switch view to foragers/hunters, <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> to switch view to gold/stone miners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. Create army from my military buildings</td>
<td>I use <kbd>D</kbd> key to go to archery ranges, <kbd>R</kbd> to go to stables</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. Check for any idles</td>
<td>I use <kbd>SPACE</kbd> key to go to idle villagers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7. Do whatever extra things i can such as walling, reassigning villagers, etc.</td>
<td>I put control group numbers <kbd>3</kbd> or <kbd>7</kbd> on my builders or villagers out in the open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I REPEAT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7</td>
<td>I REPEAT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>[/su_table]</p><p>The table above represents my rhythm and please feel free to use it or discover your own music. There is only one rule to make a successful rhythm and that rule is to always prioritize important tasks.&nbsp;Giving priority to the wrong tasks is going to change the outcome of the game.</p><p>Bear in mind this is a dual challenge you need to (1)<strong>use this rhythm or write yours</strong> + (2)<strong>repeat it as fast as you can and even under enemy pressure</strong>.</p><p>It should take time before singing your song and taking on every game. Just keep practicing the same rhythm over and over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use My AoC Practice Sheet</h2><p>
<div style="width: 1013px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="" alt="AoC Practice Sheet by GregStein" width="1003" height="374" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Practice_Sheet.jpg"><p class="wp-caption-text">AoC Practice Sheet by GregStein</p></div>
</p><p>Not a long ago and while I was practicing a lot of 1v1 games I came up with an idea to collect my gameplay issues in an organized table sheet.</p><p>It was mandatory to establish this sheet as I played around 10 games a day but more importantly I couldn&rsquo;t keep track of my common mistakes, errors and bad habits.</p><p>The idea behind this practice sheet is extracting all kind of gameplay issues we are facing then in the next game we concentrate mainly on avoiding those issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a my <a title="AoC Practice Sheet" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_21WgbQD36ejSrr19a1P0XJT7UdDzHeHr5YbWf3T6k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AoC Practice Sheet</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Problem</strong></span></p><p>For example, if you struggle finding your sheep or boars the next game you must give 90% of your energy to improve your scouting and finding your resources before 5 mins in-game time.</p><p>Another common issue that a beginner struggles with is NOT keeping the town center pumping villagers. The next game they must give priority to making villagers first and foremost (Town center always queuing villagers without any second of delay) then do the rest of the tasks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Solution</span></strong></p><p>I have published a few videos where I jumped into a random 1v1 game of low skilled players and collected their issues into the practice sheet professionally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97C4H5BxMXE&rdquo;]</p><p style="text-align: center;">[su_youtube url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmW1UmDb848&Prime;]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Visual Mods &amp; Game Settings</h2><p>The biggest part of being a good player is taking advantage of any mod you can get. I&rsquo;m not talking about &ldquo;No birds, No plants&rdquo; or terrain mods&hellip; Because all of the mods that beautify the view of the game are more or less optional.</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_5]</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about..</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Small Trees</h3><p>
<div id="attachment_972" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-972" class="size-large wp-image-972" src="" alt="small trees - Decreases the height of trees for better visibility" width="620" height="349" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020-569x320.jpg 569w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020-768x432.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/small-trees-de-2020-1024x576.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-972" class="wp-caption-text">small trees &ndash; Decreases the height of trees for better visibility</p></div>
</p><p>This mod is a user experience improver and not a single experienced player can play competitively or hop into multiplayer without it.</p><p>If you take 2 experienced players of the same level. One player consuming small trees mod while the other player is not. The player without mods will sweat his ass off to reassign lumberjacks to nearby trees since the original big trees will deny you from clicking accurately on a desired tree especially if they take any forest in the back of their base.</p><p>Besides it&rsquo;s difficult to spot your own villagers behind forests&hellip;And it becomes even more challenging if you pick green color (p3).</p><p><strong>INSTALL LINK:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/790/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/790/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Light Grid Mod</h3><p>

The grid helps as to where to lay down quick palisade walls. One square represents a foundation for a palisade wall or stone wall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Solution</span></strong></p><p>Thanks to the grids I know exactly where to build palisades precisely&hellip; However the grids shines the most on maps with elevations where it&rsquo;s impossible to see a hidden square in your walls and that usually could cost you the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that some of you including myself may not enjoy little squares all over the place that is why there is a light grid mod version reducing the grid thickness to exquisite light barely noticeable squares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Huge Number</h3><p>

A lot of pictures and illustrations are enclosed to assist my short and concise explanations.<p>Feel free to expand the &ldquo;guide contents&rdquo; to hop into topics of your interest.</p><h2>Civilizations &amp; Campaigns</h2><p>[wp_ad_camp_4]</p><h3>Civilizations &ndash; What&rsquo;s New?</h3><p>4 new civilizations are introduced into AOE 2 Definitive:</p><ol>

</p><p>The game comes with 27 campaigns (2 new campaigns) and each campaign has several chapters spanning over 200 hours of gameplays and 1000 years of human history. You won&rsquo;t need to take history classes anymore because of this..</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-946 size-large" src="" alt="history ingame learning" width="620" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-1024x529.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-620x320.jpg 620w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-768x397.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-622x320.jpg 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring.jpg 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/history-ingame-leanring-1024x529.jpg"></a></p><p>Or play the campaigns to learn the history course in an audio/visual approach. <strong>Well If I had a 13 years old son or daughter I would definitely get AoE2 Definitive for them.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Historical Battles</h3><p>There is no doubt that most of us have loved Age of Empires 2 due to quality campaigns game-plays we enjoyed in our childhood. Now and even if you have finished all the campaign missions you can still get a taste of historical battles which are 16 battles in total.</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-948 size-large" src="" alt="Historical battles" width="620" height="408" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles-486x320.jpg 486w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles-768x506.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles.jpg 1467w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Historical-battles-1024x674.jpg"></a></p><p>I personally couldn&rsquo;t be more satisfied with all these campaigns and historical battles. I&rsquo;m definitely hoping into a few historical battles after writing this post.</p><h2>Single Player &ndash; What&rsquo;s New?</h2><p>[wp_ad_camp_5]</p><p>Major graphical changes have been made to Single Player supplemented with a few interesting additions. Let&rsquo;s have a look..</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-932 size-large" src="" alt="Single player for AoE2 DE 2019" width="620" height="411" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de-1024x679.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de-482x320.jpg 482w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de-768x509.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de.jpg 1354w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/single-player-aoe2de-1024x679.jpg"></a></p><p>At the first sight, we notice that the single player structure remained the same <strong>except for the number of players</strong> which has been moved under the player spots &ndash; It&rsquo;s so much better that way in a sense of visibility.</p><h3>New Presentation for Maps</h3><p>Locations or (Maps) have gotten better..</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-933 size-large" src="" alt="Locations and maps pool - AoE2 DE" width="620" height="396" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de-501x320.jpg 501w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de-768x491.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de.jpg 1406w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/locations-maps-pool-aoe2de-1024x654.jpg"></a></p><p>There are 9 Game Modes so far:</p><ol>
<li>Random Maps</li>
<li>Empire Wars</li>
<li>Regicide</li>
<li>King of the Hill</li>
<li>Death Match</li>
<li>Sudden Death</li>
<li>Capture the Relic</li>
<li>Defend the Wonder</li>
<li>Wonder</li>
</ol><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_1]</p><p>And 4 Map Styles:</p><ol>
<li>Standard</li>
<li>Real World</li>
<li>Special Maps</li>
<li>Custom</li>
</ol><p>Yet another fantastic feature &ldquo;Map Filtering&rdquo;.

color: #fff;">Single</span>&rdquo; to the right hand side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then for example let&rsquo;s filter out only open maps and as you can see below all open maps are highlighted in yellow</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/map-filterring-aoe2de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-934 size-large" src="" alt="map filterring aoe2de" width="620" height="396" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/map-filterring-aoe2de-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/map-filterring-aoe2de-501x320.jpg 501w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/map-filterring-aoe2de-768x491.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/map-filterring-aoe2de.jpg 1406w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/map-filterring-aoe2de-1024x654.jpg"></a></p><p>Back to the Single Player main screen to have a look at a few more additions.</p><h3>Extreme Difficulty</h3><p>The AI can now play in &ldquo;<strong>extreme&rdquo;</strong> difficulty which is supposed to be more challenging than &ldquo;hardest&rdquo;</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/extreme-difficulty.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-949 size-full" src="" alt="extreme difficulty AI" width="490" height="315" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/extreme-difficulty.jpg"></a></p><h3>Infinite Resources</h3><p>You can typically play casual or practice games without having to worry anymore about harvesting resources.</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/infinite-resources.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-950 size-full" src="" alt="infinite resources" width="490" height="315" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/infinite-resources.jpg"></a></p><h3>Team &amp;

What&rsquo;s New?</h2><p>The multiplayer has gotten a complete overhaul and it&rsquo;s amazing..</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiplayer-first-look.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-936 size-large" src="" alt="multiplayer first look" width="620" height="424" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiplayer-first-look-1024x700.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiplayer-first-look-468x320.jpg 468w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiplayer-first-look-768x525.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiplayer-first-look.jpg 1499w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiplayer-first-look-1024x700.jpg"></a></p><p>Already 6 sections which we will be going through one by one.</p><h3>Ranked Queue</h3><p>Starting with the <strong>Ranked</strong> Tab: It&rsquo;s a ranked queue system where you are matched with random players at a click of a button. You can choose your civilization, map settings and match type/size (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4).</p><p style="text-align: center;">[wp_ad_camp_2]</p><p>After pressing &ldquo;Find Match&rdquo; you should be queued for a game..</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ranked-queue.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-937 size-large" src="" alt="ranked queue" width="620" height="424" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ranked-queue-1024x700.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ranked-queue-468x320.jpg 468w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ranked-queue-768x525.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ranked-queue.jpg 1499w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ranked-queue-1024x700.jpg"></a></p><p>..Pretty cool! isn&rsquo;t it?</p><h3>Lobby Browser (Unranked)</h3><p>Most of you are familiar with the lobby browser. In AoE2 DE, this latter still works like the lobby browser of AoE2 2013 (a.k.a HD) except that all hosted games are unranked.</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lobby-browser-aoe2de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-938 size-large" src="" alt="Lobby Browser" width="620" height="424" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lobby-browser-aoe2de-1024x700.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lobby-browser-aoe2de-468x320.jpg 468w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lobby-browser-aoe2de-768x525.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lobby-browser-aoe2de.jpg 1499w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lobby-browser-aoe2de-1024x700.jpg"></a></p><p>Have you noticed &ldquo;Connection Quality&rdquo; to the right hand side? That should keep you away from joining laggy regions which in this example are marked with a red square <strong>Southest Asia</strong> and <strong>Brazilsouth</strong>.</p><p>Also upon hosting your own lobby ensure the selection of servers accordingly to the green square. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the brand new features for &ldquo;Create Lobby&rdquo;</p><p><a href="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Create-Lobby.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-939" src="" alt="Create Lobby" width="474" height="383" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Create-Lobby.jpg 714w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Create-Lobby-397x320.jpg 397w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Create-Lobby.jpg"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It looks gorgeous! We can notice 3 new features:</p><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Hide Civilizations&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;icon: check-square&rdquo;]Renders Civilizations hidden to all players until the game starts.[/su_service]</p><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Spectator Delay&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;icon: check-square&rdquo;]Set a delay time for spectators preventing any form of spec-cheating.[/su_service]</p><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Server&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;icon: check-square&rdquo;]Choose your regional server.

Health Bars are annoying in this current patch and unresponsive.

Take a lot at this proof</p><p>

Lag is measured based on your internet speed and ping.</p><p>A minimum requirement is 2 MB download, 0.3 Upload and a low Ping which is also crucial to communicate with multiplayer servers.&nbsp; Because It determines how much delay you are getting in the course of the game-play. However the game is less likely to stuffer as in peer-to-peer.</p><h2>What if one or more than one player are lagging, would they affect the rest of the players?</h2><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-918 size-medium" src="" alt="multiplayer reasons to lose" width="368" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png 368w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-lag-reasons-e1560474999830-368x320.png"></p><p>No! Whoever lags will lag himself not others. 3G internet speed of at least 2 MB download, 0.3 upload and a decent ping is the bare minimum for an average to good multiplayer experience.</p><h2>What if my internet drops for less than 60 seconds, would I get back to the game?</h2><p><img class="size-medium wp-image-908 alignnone" src="" alt="drops in aoe2 de are fixed" width="448" height="320" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop-448x320.jpg 448w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2hd-drop-448x320.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes! One of the outstanding advantages of this brand-new multiplayer is the ability to get back into the game if you have dropped for less 60 seconds, therefore, other players won&rsquo;t have to save and exit then restore again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What if the servers are down, Can we play multiplayer?</h2><p><img class=" wp-image-909 alignnone" src="" alt="servers are down thus multiplayer" width="430" height="228" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg 603w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-768x407.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-300x160.jpg 300w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down.jpg 950w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Xbox-Live-servers-down-603x320.jpg"></p><p>No! When the servers are down you have to wait until they are back on to play multiplayer, however you can still play single player or watch recorded games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>In a multiplayer game, My game crashed and shut down, Can I run it again and get back to game?</h2><p><img class=" wp-image-910 alignnone" src="" alt="game crashing unexpectedly" width="495" height="171" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png 622w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/game-crash-622x215.png"></p><p>Yes! When your game shuts down while playing multiplayer, you should be able to get back to the game but you have to join in less than 60 seconds or whatever the timeout is set to. Also It depends if this feature is implemented or not however it is entirely possible to add.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Would players in a far region struggle with other regions?</h2><p><img class="wp-image-912 alignnone" src="" alt="regions and pings" width="452" height="532" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/regions-and-pings-1.png"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Australia, and Asia may get 500 &ndash; 200 ping with Europe+North Africa/America regions. It always has been like that but at least the pings have the potential to be way better than the peer-to-peer version. I expect server coverage for every region so low pings are guaranteed, except the south African region which has been challenging for them to get any multiplayer coverage in the last years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Would there be live profile stats for players on the internet?</h2><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-913 size-full" src="" alt="live game stats for aoe 2 de" width="479" height="448" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png 479w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287-342x320.png 342w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2stats-e1560464555287.png"></p><p>Yes, It&rsquo;s entirely possible to have your profile stats saved on your xbox profile, but the question is, have they planned it yet?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Would players be able to fake their ELO?</h2><p><img class="size-large wp-image-915 alignnone" src="" alt="cheating in age of empires 2" width="620" height="395" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-502x320.jpg 502w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-768x490.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193.jpg 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/aoe2-hacks-e1560466031193-1024x653.jpg"></p><p>No! It&rsquo;s almost impossible. The only way to fake ELO is to deliberately cheat to earn ELO, and that should be more challenging than before. With the a presence of a good anticheat, people reporting and the live game stats; cheaters would be caught like rats in a trap.</p><h2></h2><h2>Irrelevant to multiplayer, but do I need a bigger monitor to see the game zoomed out?</h2><p><img class="size-large wp-image-917 alignnone" src="" alt="age of empires 2 definitive x4 zoom" width="620" height="345" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-1024x569.jpg 1024w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-576x320.jpg 576w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-768x427.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOEII_definitive_zoom-1024x569.jpg"></p><p>No, You don&rsquo;t! Any laptop or screen profits from x4 zoom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope I have answered as many questions as possible. Feel free to ask more in the comment section and I will answer them for you.</p></p>

</p><p>Let&rsquo;s understand what I mean by peer-to-peer and client server.</p><h2>Peer to Peer Vs Client Server</h2><p><img class=" wp-image-900 alignnone" src="" alt="Multiplayer lag in Age of Empires 2 hd" width="545" height="302" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ageofempires2-lag-multiplayer-e1560096858294.jpg 588w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ageofempires2-lag-multiplayer-e1560096858294-577x320.jpg 577w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ageofempires2-lag-multiplayer-e1560096858294.jpg"></p><p>I will give straight forward examples to paint the picture. To give these examples meaning, I have made up two players from my imagination to help you understand easier:<br>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>has a high ping (bad internet) and slow computer.</p><p><span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player has a low ping (good internet) and fast computer.</p><h3>Peer to Peer</h3><p><strong>Peer to Peer</strong> Multiplayer e.g.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific</span> is playing against <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span>. Peer-to-Peer network results&nbsp; ==&gt; <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player with good internet/computer is impacted severely by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>player ping and computer lag. End results, the game lags for everyone.</p><p>Explanation: <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player awaits actions and commands to be executed and sent from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>(the lagger), and that takes a long time (1, 2, 10, etc. seconds) &ndash; this is the definition of network lag.</p><h3>Client-Server</h3><p><strong>Client Server</strong> Multiplayer e.g.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>is playing against <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span>. Client Server network result ==&gt; <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> player is enjoying game after another without any lag impact from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>the lagger.</p><p>Explanation: Actions and commands executed by both players <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>and <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> are decided by the server; therefore, <span style="color: #339966;">Rocketman</span> will have a clear advantage over <span style="color: #ff0000;">Laggerific </span>if ever the game goes down to micro.</p><h3>Who wins?</h3><p>To conclude, Client Server multiplayer rewards players with good internet connection and decent computer. Peer-to-Peer punishes all players when one of players is lagging.</p><p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Client Server wins.</span></strong></p><p>We will soon find out later today on E3 Expo&hellip;</p><h3>Good News and Conclusion</h3><p>As of today and after 4 days, It has been confirmed by <a href="https://www.aoezone.net/threads/june-12-17-45-gmt-aoe2-de-first-live-stream-with-cysion.156330/page-3#post-621888" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cysion in this post</a> that Age of Empires 2 DE will be getting Client Server multiplayer. Finally we can put the struggle of those laggy multiplayer behind us.</p></p>

Now Enter &ldquo;Profiles&rdquo; folder.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-824" src="" alt="Profiles Folder of Age of Empires 2" width="666" height="372" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ProfilesFolder.jpg 666w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ProfilesFolder-573x320.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ProfilesFolder.jpg"></p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Situation 1:</strong></span> If you only see &ldquo;player0.hki&rdquo; in there, all you have to do is extract &ldquo;player0.hki&rdquo; from any player in &ldquo;HotkeyProfiles_AoE2.zip&rdquo; then replace the one inside your &ldquo;Profiles&rdquo; folder. Done!</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Situation 2:</strong></span> If you see many player profiles such as (player0.hki, player1.hki, player4.hki, player13.hki) &ndash; simply sort files by &ldquo;Date modified&rdquo;</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-825" src="" alt="sort hotkey files by date modified" width="666" height="396" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sort_files_by_date_modified.jpg 666w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sort_files_by_date_modified-538x320.jpg 538w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sort_files_by_date_modified.jpg"></p><p>From the example above it&rsquo;s obvious that &ldquo;player4.hki&rdquo; is the one that needs to be replaced and to do that extract &ldquo;player0.hki&rdquo; from &ldquo;HotkeyProfiles_AoE2.zip&rdquo; to your desktop and rename it &ldquo;player4.hki&rdquo;.

And most of the times, it is a nightmare to set up Voobly and fixing stubborn issues with the game.</p><p>Well, the good news is&hellip; <a href="https://github.com/gregstein/AoE2Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AoE2ToolsCloud</a> is fully supported on Wine. All you have to do is install steam through a wine32 bit installation (which I am going to show you how to set it up later on this post) and login to your account.</p><p><del>No need to install Age of Empires 2 HD on steam!</del> Cool, isn&rsquo;t it? &ndash; However, you must own all three DLCS to use the tool.</p><p>These are the 3 DLCS you need to own on your account:</p><ol>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239550/Age_of_Empires_II_HD_The_Forgotten/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Forgotten Empires</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/355950/Age_of_Empires_II_HD_The_African_Kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">African Kingdoms</a></li>
<li><a href="http://_wp_link_placeholder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rise of Rajas</a></li>
</ol><h2>Setting Up Wine (Development) Fully 32bit</h2><h3>Install/Update graphics drivers for Linux System</h3><p>Before we jump into wine setup we should update or install any missing drivers. Fire up your terminal command</p><pre lang="bash">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
sudo apt-get update
</pre><p><em>if it asks for a restart please go ahead and restart then come back to continue from here.</em></p><h3><em><br>
</em>Clean 32bit Wine Install With 32bit Prefix (NO MONO)</h3><p>For this wine installation, we are going to use &ldquo;<strong>Wine (development version)</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>winetricks</strong>&rdquo; available on your Software Center.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">(YOU MUST INSTALL THROUGH SOFTWARE CENTER NOT TERMINAL ELSE IT WON&rsquo;T WORK!!)</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-803" src="" alt="ubuntu software center wine" width="662" height="464" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/software-center-wine.png.jpg 1200w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/software-center-wine.png-457x320.jpg 457w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/software-center-wine.png-768x538.jpg 768w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/software-center-wine.png-1024x718.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/software-center-wine.png.jpg"></p><p>Once that&rsquo;s done! Run the following command to set up wine32bit with a 32bit prefix:</p><pre lang="bash">WINEPREFIX="$HOME/win32" WINEARCH=win32 wine wineboot</pre><p>Then you need to set your 32bit prefix to windows 10</p><pre lang="bash">WINEPREFIX="$HOME/win32" WINEARCH=win32 winecfg</pre><p>Now your prefix should be ready for winetricks.</p><h3>Installing Libraries Components Through Winetricks</h3><p>Before we proceed with the bash commands, take a few seconds to educate yourself abtout the basic requirements for every app we are about to use:</p><ul>
<li><strong>AoE2Tools requires (cmd,&nbsp;corefonts,&nbsp;dotnet45 or dotnet461)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Age of Empires 2 on Voobly (corefonts,&nbsp;directplay, directx, quartz)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Steam (corefonts,&nbsp;quartz,&nbsp;wininet, other libraries were&nbsp;omitted&nbsp;that may break dotnet461 installation)</strong></li>
</ul><p>[su_service title=&rdquo;Ignore Dotnet Errors&rdquo; icon=&rdquo;icon: hand-o-right&rdquo;]Ignore dotnet errors &ldquo;Mono does not appear to be installed!&rdquo;. Just press OK if that error is prompted until it starts&nbsp;downloading and installing all dotnet requirements before installing dotnet461.</p><p>If dot461 fails to install whereas dotnet45 has installed, well then that&rsquo;s fine! It&rsquo;s all we needed.</p><p>[/su_service]</p><pre lang="bash">WINEPREFIX="$HOME/win32" WINEARCH=win32 winetricks corefonts

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some may argue that stealing boars and sheep early on is unfair while some would say &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of the game&rdquo;. When I was noob I personally used to get offended when someone steals one of my boars or my last two sheep.<p>I was offended in way that I was waiting for any window of opportunity to pay them back. Occasionally my opponents asked for a pause but I didn&rsquo;t allow it. Or when they drop I did not save. Salt was coming out of my nose every time I was lamed or lose to those shenanigans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only back then I was an angry noob and didn&rsquo;t know how to play age of empires 2 without boars and sheep. Until I came across KKab replays. Those have changed my salt levels 180 degree.</p><p>In fact, I have started enjoying the game much more than previously. I was also able to pull some nasty moves; for instance this 5000 IQ boar block by me:</p><p>[su_youtube_advanced url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo8YMNqF6SA&rdquo; width=&rdquo;320&Prime; height=&rdquo;280&Prime; autohide=&rdquo;yes&rdquo; theme=&rdquo;light&rdquo; https=&rdquo;yes&rdquo;]</p><p>Or surviving an ultra lamer:</p><p>[su_youtube_advanced url=&rdquo;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBDw7p4DBGA&rdquo; width=&rdquo;320&Prime; height=&rdquo;280&Prime; autohide=&rdquo;yes&rdquo; theme=&rdquo;light&rdquo; https=&rdquo;yes&rdquo;]</p><p>Today, I will be showing you how to play Age of Empires 2 without 1 or 2 boars; without 2, 4, or 6 sheep. I will also add recorded games to download at the end of every section for you to watch on Steam/Voobly. Again credits to Kkab, one of the legends of Age of empires 2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>When a Boar or Sheep steal take place?</h3><p>The boar steal usually takes place around the 3 &ndash; 6 min mark. Use this tip to have your scout nearby your boar in Patrol/Aggressive stance.</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-490" src="" alt="Patrol Command In Age of Empires 2" width="425" height="347" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Agressive-patrol.jpg 425w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Agressive-patrol-392x320.jpg 392w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Agressive-patrol.jpg"></p><p>You may be able to scare your enemy away or you can try to <strong>block his scout</strong> from stealing the boar by <strong>moving your own scout diagonally</strong> between the running boar and the enemy scout.</p><p>
<div id="attachment_495" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-495" class="wp-image-495 size-full" src="" alt="Boar Blocking In Age of Empires 2" width="580" height="333" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boar-block.jpg 580w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boar-block-557x320.jpg 557w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boar-block.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-495" class="wp-caption-text">Boar Blocking In Age of Empires 2</p></div>
</p><p>Sheep steal usually occur around <span style="color: #0000ff;">2:10</span> &ndash; <span style="color: #0000ff;">6</span> min and sometimes later. The only tip I can give you to practice scouting your base better. I recommend this guide : <a title="Step By Step Scouting For Beginners in Age of Empires 2" href="https://ageofnotes.com/beginners/step-step-scouting-beginners-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Step By Step Scouting For Beginners in Age of Empires 2</a>. It is also important to <a title="3 Effective Ways of Scouting in Age Of Empires 2" href="https://ageofnotes.com/tutorials/scout-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scout your enemy</a> so you can anticipate him and then it&rsquo;s up to you whether to play defensive or aggressive.&nbsp;However if your boar is stolen, do not panic. As throughout this guide you will learn how you can easily play without it.</p><blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> A drawback to stealing a boar is a scout with less hp. Try to chase the low hp scout and kill it, preferably when you are about to hit Feudal age. This way you reduce his scouting information then you can use that to your advantage and send a villager to build a tower behind his lumberjacks or do an unusual strategy to take him by surprise or slow him down.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How does a lamer think?</h3><p>This is really important! I may not be completely right, but at least when I play them and I have played so many of them from different skill level and play styles. What they usually try to pull is illustrated in the following scenarios:</p><p>
<div id="attachment_491" style="width: 388px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-491" class="wp-image-491 size-full" src="" alt="Scenario 1 (Boar Steal =&gt; Drush/Drush + FC)" width="378" height="248" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Boar-Steal-Scenario-1.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-491" class="wp-caption-text">Scenario 1 (Boar Steal =&gt; Drush/Drush + FC)</p></div>
<div id="attachment_492" style="width: 388px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-492" class="wp-image-492 size-full" src="" alt="Scenario 2 (Boar Steal =&gt; Scout Rush/Full Scout Rush)" width="378" height="230" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Boar-Steal-Scenario-2.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-492" class="wp-caption-text">Scenario 2 (Boar Steal =&gt; Scout Rush/Full Scout Rush)</p></div>
<div id="attachment_493" style="width: 422px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493" class="wp-image-493 size-full" src="" alt="Scenario 3 (Boar Steal =&gt; Foward Rush/Tower Rush)" width="412" height="230" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Boar-Steal-Scenario-3.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-493" class="wp-caption-text">Scenario 3 (Boar Steal =&gt; Foward Rush/Tower Rush)</p></div>
<div id="attachment_494" style="width: 442px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-494" class="wp-image-494" src="" alt="Scenario 4 (Boar Steal =&gt; FC + Knights/FC + Castle + UU)" width="432" height="250" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Boar-Steal-Scenario-4.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-494" class="wp-caption-text">Scenario 4 (Boar Steal =&gt; FC + Knights/FC + Castle + UU)</p></div>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From those scenarios you can tell that stealing is essentially a strategy ingredient. Therefore do not let a boar steal affect your build order, because you would be giving up an advantage to your enemy. Read the next section of this guide to learn how to recover from a stolen boar or sheep. (Recorded game lessons are available to download as well)</p><h2>How to Play without 1 Boar (Common)</h2><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484" src="" alt="" width="216" height="135" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boar-340food.jpg"></p><p>Here is how you should adapt your build order:</p><p>(Seeing the enemy stealing your boar)</p><p><strong>If you have loom (Population 12) becomes (Population 11), etc.</strong></p><p>3:20 min (12 Population) This Villager that comes out should lure the other boar (meanwhile you are consuming a sheep.</p><p>3:45 min (13 Population) Bring down the boar and now you should have 9 villagers consuming the boar. Remove 1 villager from the boar and send it to berries (you only need 8 on boar). Build a mill whenever you have 100 wood.</p><p>4:10 min (14 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 2 foragers)</p><p>4:35 min (15 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 3 foragers)</p><p>5:00 min (16 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 4 foragers)</p><p>5:25 min (17 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 5 foragers). Your boar is done now. Just start consuming sheep. And make a farm whenever you have 60 wood.</p><p>5:50 min (18 Population) This villager goes to berries (total 6 foragers)</p><p>6:15 min (19 Population) This villager takes any struggler &ldquo;tree&rdquo; near your town center. You have two farms now and need to make a third farm soon.</p><p>6:40 min (20 Population) This villager becomes a shepherd (consumes sheep as well)</p><p>7:05 min (21 Population) This villager joins lumberjacks (total 4 lumberjacks)</p><p>7&nbsp;: 30 min (22 Population) This villager also joins lumberjacks (total 5 lumberjacks); also Research Loom.</p><p>7:55 or 7:45 min (22 Population) At Loom researched! Click Feudal Age. And villagers that are done with sheep set them to take nearby struggler trees for few seconds. Then Grab 5 villagers from strugglers to build a new lumber camp. 2 Villagers left on strugglers should build a barracks at 60% &ndash; 70%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meantime you may try to find enemy scout. Because when you reach feudal age your scout becomes faster than a Dark Age scout. So you can chase it and kill it easily.</p><p>Once you reach Feudal age you can build your stable as if nothing happened. Maybe your build order is now even better with 3 farms.</p><p>Download and Watch One of The Recorded Games For a Live Example:</p><p><strong>Play Without 1 Boar Recorded Game For Steam (AoE2HD 5.8)</strong></p><p>[su_button url=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Play-without-1-Boar-AoE2HD-5.8.zip&rdquo; radius=&rdquo;0&Prime;]Download (AoE2HD 5.8)[/su_button]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Play Without 1 Boar Recorded Game For Voobly (Userpatch 1.5 RC)</strong></p><p>[su_button url=&rdquo;https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Play-without-1-Boar-1.5-RC.zip&rdquo; radius=&rdquo;0&Prime;]Download (UserPatch 1.5RC)[/su_button]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Play without 2 Boars</h2><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-485" src="" alt="" width="216" height="135" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/boars-680food.jpg"></p><p>There is only 1 chance out a 100 for this to happen, especially if you have 2 forward boars at the same spot.

That&rsquo;s a lot of food lost, because Horse collar and double bit axe feudal upgrades together cost <span style="color: #ff0000;">175</span> food and 125 wood.

Before we get into it. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some scouting styles.</p><h2>How to Scout Your Map Area in Age of Empires 2</h2><p>To bring some legitimacy to this guide. I have downloaded 10 random recorded games from each player (TheViper, MBL,&nbsp;Bact, and Daut.) And only observed how they scout. I found that all of them seem to scout their base in 3 different ways:</p><p>
<div id="attachment_264" style="width: 359px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-264" class="wp-image-264 size-full" title="1/4 scouting style" src="" alt="1/4 scouting style" width="349" height="174" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/explore-square-shape.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-264" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>1/4 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Square</span>-Scouting style</strong></p></div>
<div id="attachment_266" style="width: 357px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266" class="size-full wp-image-266" src="" alt="1/4 Circle Scouting Style" width="347" height="174" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/explore-circle.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-266" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>1/4 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Circle</span>-Scouting Style</strong></p></div>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">To conclude:</span></strong></p><ul>
<li>1/4 scouting styles are usually done in 02:30 mins (at most). Then you start looking for the enemy.</li>
<li>1/2 scouting style is done around 04:30 mins (at most). Then you start looking for the enemy.</li>
</ul><p>Now, you may think that both styles are the same. But&hellip; that is probably not true!</p><p>Starting with 1/2. It seemed like a very <span style="color: #ff0000;">rare</span> scouting style among players that play <strong>(defensive</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>very economical, greedy</strong> and also <strong>smart wallers</strong><strong>.)</strong></p><p>1/4.&nbsp;It seemed like a <span style="color: #ff0000;">very common</span> scouting style among players that mostly execute aggression like a <strong>(Drush</strong> or <strong>Flush.)</strong></p><p>I am not saying that (100% of the times) if a player X does 1/2 scouting then he is going to wall or play defensive and economical&hellip; It&rsquo;s just a theory.</p><p><strong>Overall, 1/4 scouting is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">RECOMMENDED</span> scouting shape. Since it is used almost every game.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a beginner please go to <a href="https://ageofnotes.com/beginners/step-step-scouting-beginners-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Step By Step Scouting Guide for beginners</a> to learn about&nbsp;scouting.</p><p>Now Let&rsquo;s move to the scouting practices.</p><h2>3 Ways To Scout An Enemy in Age of Empires 2</h2><p>There are three ways that I found frequently employed by Top Players in Age of Empires 2.</p><h3>Rectal Shape</h3><p>Rectal? I am very sorry about the name &ldquo;Rectal&rdquo;. I googled it and this came up lol</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-284" src="" alt="rectal shape" width="249" height="194" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rectal-shape.png"></p><p>So yeah this is how your stomach looks like hahaha&hellip;</p><p>Now here is how the &ldquo;Rectal Shape&rdquo; looks in the minimap</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-282 aligncenter" src="" alt="viper scouting" width="575" height="379" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/viper-scouting.jpg 575w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/viper-scouting-485x320.jpg 485w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/viper-scouting.jpg"></p><p>The image demonstrates two possible options. You simply <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>exactly follow the 1,2,3 arrows</strong></span>. And It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you start scouting from the top or bottom. It&rsquo;s the same thing!</p><p>This method of scouting was initially posted in detail on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgottenempires.net/aof/strategy/scouting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">forgottenempires.net&nbsp;</a> and <a href="http://www.cysion.be/aocbox/?p=200" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cysion blog</a>.</p><h3>Deep Sea Worm shape</h3><p>Do not even get me started on this one.. please!!! I know that this is starting to sound like a Pokemon guide. Forgive my&nbsp;innocence! I googled &ldquo;Deep sea worm&rdquo; and this came up&hellip;</p><p><img class="wp-image-285 aligncenter" src="" alt="Deep Sea Worm" width="396" height="263" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DeepSeaWorm-e1511381846282.jpg 612w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DeepSeaWorm-e1511381846282-481x320.jpg 481w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DeepSeaWorm-e1511381846282.jpg"></p><p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at Daut&rsquo;s &ldquo;Deep Sea Worm&rdquo; LMAO</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-288 aligncenter" src="" alt="deep sea worm daut scouting" width="575" height="379" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/daut-scouting.jpg 575w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/daut-scouting-485x320.jpg 485w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/daut-scouting.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Be warned!</strong> This scouting is maybe faster. However, your scout is likely to bump into the enemy&rsquo;s Town center. Especially, if you are distracted or busy during a boar lure.</p><h3>Lucky Bishop Shape</h3><p>Surely, you are already familiar with Chess. The Bishop is a piece of chess that moves diagonally like this&hellip;</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-290 aligncenter" src="" alt="bishop shape scouting" width="293" height="291" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bishop-shape.gif"></p><p>Sometimes, when players are in any corner of the map. They tend to send their scout to whatever corner is in front.</p><p>Here is an example from MBL</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-291" src="" alt="bishop scouting shape" width="575" height="379" srcset="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mbl-scouting.jpg 575w, https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mbl-scouting-485x320.jpg 485w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mbl-scouting.jpg"></p><p>Bear in mind that the following this scouting approach. May <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>not be as accurate</strong></span> as &ldquo;Rectal Scouting&rdquo;. However, If you are an advanced lucky player. utilizing &ldquo;bishop shape scouting&rdquo; will certainly help you find your enemy faster than &ldquo;Deep Sea Worm Scouting&rdquo;.</p><p>As a final note, the <strong>Rectal shape</strong> is probably the best here. Specifically, players &ldquo;deep-inside&rdquo; struggling with scouting.</p><p>[wp_ad_camp_1]</p></p>

</ul><h2>How To Deal With A Trush?</h2><p>First off, Let&rsquo;s start by putting some basics into perspective&hellip;</p><ul>
<li>Do you have <strong>Forward</strong> Gold and Stone piles?</li>
</ul><p><span style="color: #008000;">Tip:</span> Build your barracks <strong>in Front</strong> of them.</p><ul>
<li>Do you have a&nbsp;<strong>Forward</strong> Wood patch?</li>
</ul><p><span style="color: #008000;">Tip:</span> Always and First of all take wood at the <strong>Back</strong> of your town center.</p><ul>
<li>Do&nbsp;you randomly construct buildings?<span style="color: #008000;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul><p><span style="color: #008000;">Tip:</span> Construct your buildings <strong>Forward</strong> in a form of a&nbsp;<strong>Wall.</strong></p><p>There are certainly many ways to which you can stop a Trush. And I going to be covering as many as possible.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s learn how to defend a Trush&hellip;</p><h3>Standard Economical Defensive Strategy</h3><p>My personal favorite and by far the easiest and most successful. Especially when executed correctly.</p><p>This is a 22 pop standard scout rush build order. However, in the following example that you are about to see. Blue player built an archery range instead of a stable. Why? The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red player</span> can <strong>NOT</strong> invest in an early skirmisher war because he only has few lumberjacks and low food income.</p><p>Which makes sense.. As in, later on, The <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue player</span> will only make archers and farms to get ahead.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-149 aligncenter" src="" alt="Build Forward Barrack " width="450" height="217" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/11/trush-barrack-position.jpg"></p><p>Thanks to the forward barracks above, the&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue Player&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;">was able&nbsp;to spot the first tower from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red Player</span></span></span></p><p><img class="wp-image-150 aligncenter" src="" alt="Barracks line of sight" width="460" height="256" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/11/barrack-extra-vision.jpg"></p><p>Straight-up here is how <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue player</span> reacted to that tower:</p><ul>
<li>Queued 2 Militias at the barracks.</li>
<li>Sent 3 more villagers + 2 builders which are a total of 5 villagers.</li>
<li>Uses the scout carefully Not to lose it so he&nbsp;picks off running injured villagers.</li>
</ul><p>Here are the results:</p><p>
<div id="attachment_152" style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152" class="wp-image-152" src="" alt="Red Player: 4 Villagers and a scout are down." width="464" height="257" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/11/defending-first-trusher-tower.jpg"><p id="caption-attachment-152" class="wp-caption-text">Red Player: 4 Villagers and a scout are down.</p></div>
</p><p>Seeing that he was winning the fight and denying an enemy building. He instantly sent 4 villagers to mine gold while he already built an archery range&nbsp;when the fight was taking place.</p><p>At this point, If you were the <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue player</span> you would think that red would not Trush you anymore? Well! That&rsquo;s wrong!</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue Player</span> is an experienced player and He most certainly has played many&nbsp;Trushers before.</p><p><img class="wp-image-153 aligncenter" src="" alt="Outpost to counter a Trush" width="483" height="228" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/11/outpost-counter-trush.jpg"></p><p>See what he did there? In the other side of the map where his lumberjacks are chopping trees. <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue player</span> built an outpost in anticipation of another Trush attempt. Very small trick but It is certainly annoying for a Trusher to get busted by outposts.</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The blue player</span>&nbsp;also used the palisade wall trick to spot the second Trush attempt&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;">Without any scouting information</span>.</p><p>He was aware that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red player</span> is slowly building towers towards his gold miners. So <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue player</span> intentionally and smartly lets <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red player</span> waste stone on towers</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-154 aligncenter" src="" alt="" width="906" height="336" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/11/tower-rush-palisade-trick.jpg"></p><p>Once the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red player</span> has finished building his &lsquo;secret&rsquo; towers. Only now <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue player</span> starts building a defensive tower</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-155 aligncenter" src="" alt="defensive gold tower" width="470" height="283" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/11/defensive-gold-tower.jpg"></p><p>It is 22:00 mins (Ingame) And <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue player</span> has already clicked Castle Age with 17 farms, 12 lumberjacks, 9 gold miners, and 3 stone miners. The score difference is huge. Clearly <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue</span> is the obvious winner in this game.</p><p>

</p><p><strong>Could you be asking for any happier ending?</strong></p><p>The bottom line is you can go further than just defeating a Trush if you intelligently execute the strategy. Watch this recorded game [1.5 RC patch R5]</p><h3>Busted! &ldquo;I See Your Trush Mate!&rdquo;</h3><p>A Trush is originally meant to be secretly executed. Therefore, once It is detected &ndash; The chances of its success are less probable.</p><p>That is why sometimes just by <strong>Scouting</strong> your opponent mining stone <span style="color: #808080;">OR</span>&nbsp;<strong>Seeing</strong> forwarding villagers heading towards your town.</p><p>Your enemy might just give up his Trush&nbsp;and resigns <em><strong>OR</strong></em>&nbsp;return home to play defensive.</p><h3>The Trushee Becomes The Trusher</h3><p>The Trusher might hypothetically say &ldquo;I will trush&nbsp;the woodline, berries and the main gold. And as long as I am doing my thing my town will remain safe.&rdquo; He may not type that to you in chat though.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s a fact! When an aggressive player is putting pressure. He only expects defensive reactions from the opponent.</p><p>Now, how about exceeding his expectations and execute The Trush yourself?</p><p>Trush his stone miners, his berries OR Wood line. He will be forced off Trushing your town. Instead, He will go back home and put defensive towers.</p><p>You can do something like that if you feel that your opponent does not match your <a href="https://ageofnotes.com//2017/10/21/improve-multitasking-age-empires-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multitasking skills</a> or his macro is just the worst.</p><h3>Be The Smart Tower Guy</h3><p>Another option is while you are doing a standard 22 pop build order. You also add 4 stone miners and try to defend against his towers with efficiently positioned towers.</p><p><img class="wp-image-159 aligncenter" src="" alt="smart tower" width="569" height="329" data-layzr="https://ageofnotes.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/11/smart-tower-2.jpg"></p><p>Meantime, you are spamming lots of farms.</p><ul>
<li>By 16 mins research wheelbarrow</li>
<li>By 17 mins you should have at least 15 farms.</li>
<li>At 20, 21 or 22 mins you should be able to click castle age With <strong>6 Lumberjacks</strong>, <strong>11 gold miners</strong>, <strong>16 farms, 1 stone miner.</strong></li>
<li>While going up to castle age:</li>
<li>Send a forward villager nearby the enemy&rsquo;s base.</li>
<li>Build 2 stables.</li>
<li>Upgrade Gold.</li>
<li>Upgrade plate armor at The Blacksmith, and Bloodlines at the stable.</li>
</ul><p>When you reach Castle age:</p><ul>
<li>Use the forward villager to build a siege workshop and queue <strong>rams</strong> or <strong>mangonels</strong> (if the&nbsp;enemy has archers preferably mangonels then repair them using villagers).</li>
<li>Queue knights from both stables.</li>
<li>Upgrade chain barding armor at the Blacksmith.</li>
</ul><p>Once&nbsp;chain barding armor is completed. Use your knights to get as many villagers kill as possible (ignore Town center or tower fire) Your knights absorb a lot of arrows and essentially take longer to die.</p><p>

</p><p>When there is nothing to kill OR the enemy has way too many spears just retreat to spam more knights.</p><p>Eventually, if you play it cleverly the win is yours.</p><p>[wp_ad_camp_1]</p></p>
